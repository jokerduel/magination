<tr><td valign="top" width="50%">
<p>You are about to enter the
Moonlands, a place of wondrous regions created from the stuff of dreams. The
Moonlands are a mystical place filled with amazing Magi, strange Dream
Creatures, and ancient Relics of untold power. Powerful wizards and sorcerers,
the Magi hone their potent skills by dueling other Magi. They need to be the
best they can be, for the Magi of the Moonlands are fighting a war against the
vile creatures that crawl up from the core of the moon and seek to corrupt their
entire race. </p>

<p>Magi-Nation Duel&#8482; is a game
about these magical duels. Each player controls a group of three Magi. These
Magi cast Spells, conjure up Dream Creatures, and use Relics to defeat the
other group of Magi. Defeat all of the Magi that oppose you, and you win!</p>

<p>Most games of Magi-Nation Duel are played between two
players, but there&#8217;s no reason you can&#8217;t play with three or more. Whoever your
friends are, invite them to join the fun!</p>    

<h2>So How Does This Work?</h2>

<p>Magi-Nation Duel is a
collectible card game (often called a CCG). The cards represent your Magi, the
Dream Creatures they call, the Spells they cast, and the Relics they use in
their duels. </p>

<p>In a CCG, you don&#8217;t use all of
your cards at once; players build custom decks from their collection. As an
analogy, imagine you could play a game with baseball sports cards. You wouldn&#8217;t
use every baseball player in your collection at once; aside from being pretty
obnoxious, it&#8217;d be silly. Instead, you&#8217;d only choose your favorite nine players
to take the field. CCGs work in the same way. You take your best cards and make
a deck, then use that deck to play with your friends. </p>

<p>Cards come in decks and in
11-card booster packs. At this time there are over 750 cards available that you
can collect. You can buy some and trade for others, and use those cards to make
your deck better, or to make additional decks. </p>

<h2>How Can I Learn More?</h2>

<p>Magi-Nation is more than a card game, it's a story.
You can learn more in the Game Boy Color&#8482; game pak, and fiction appears
regularly on our web site. The more you explore the </p>

<p>Moonlands, the more you'll find
there is to discover!</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at the
four different types of cards in Magi-Nation Duel. </p>

</td>
<td valign="top">

<h3>Magi</h3>

<p>Magi have a circular border
around the artwork. Magi are the centerpieces of your deck and the focus of the
whole game. </p>

<p>(1) Name: This is the specific
Magi the card represents.</p>

<p>(2) Region and Profession: Here
we give the Magi&#8217;s home region, as well as what special title he or she may
have. </p>

<p>(3) Region Emblem and Edition
Mark: We put the symbol of the region here as a reminder. Also, if the card is
a first-edition printing, a Roman numeral I appears as illustrated.</p>

<p>(4) Starting Energy: This shows
how much power the Magi has available at the start.</p>

<p>(5) Artwork: Ain&#8217;t she cute?</p>

<p>(6) Energize Number: This is how
much additional power the Magi gets every turn. </p>

<p>(7) Starting Cards: Each Magi
has his or her favorite tricks; you&#8217;ll start with these cards in your
hand.</p>

<p>(8) Powers and Effects: All Magi
have special abilities unique to them; these are listed here. </p>

<p>(9) Flavor Text: This tells you
more about the Magi and the Moonlands. It has no effect on game play. </p>

<p>(10) Rarity: One dot means the
card is rare, two dots is uncommon card, three dots is common, "deck" cards
only appear fixed in a deck, and "limited" is a promo.</p>

<p>(11) Artist Credits: Praise for
the art goes here. </p>

<h3>Creatures</h3>

<p>Creatures have a rectangular
border around the picture. They are from the Dream Realm, and are called forth
by your Magi to battle opposing Magi. There are many Creatures in the game,
some weak and some powerful. All have useful Powers or Effects that can help
you defeat your opponent.</p>

<p>(1) Name: This tells you what sort of Creature it is.
Certain Creatures, like Jiles and Arbolls, appear in different forms across the
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">Page 2</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" width="50%">

<p>Moonlands; these have compound
names like Jungle Jile, Lava Arboll, etc.</p>

<p>(2) Region and Card Type:
Answers &#8216;what&#8217; and &#8216;where.&#8217;</p>

<p>(3) Region Emblem: Sightings of
this beast are common here, and around certain Magi from that region. </p>

<p>(4) Starting Energy: This is how
much energy it costs your Magi to bring the Creature into existence. This
energy is moved from your Magi to the Creature when it&#8217;s played, so the
Creature ends up with energy of its own. </p>

<p>(5) Artwork: Big, bad, and made
of living grass. </p>

<p>(6) Powers and Effects: Like
Magi, Creatures have their own abilities that they can perform using their own
energy. </p>

<p>(7) Flavor Text: Has no real
effect, unless you quote it. </p>

<p>(8) Rarity: Has no bearing on
how many people use it in their decks.</p>

<p>(9) Artist Credits: In case you
want to get them to sign your card at a convention or something. </p>

<h3>Relics</h3>

<p>Relics all have a hexagonal
(six-sided) border around the picture. Relics are mystical artifacts, and have
a wide variety of functions for your Magi to use. Some Relics remain in play,
while others get discarded when you use them. </p>

<p>(1) Name: Why are you reading
this definition? Surely you know what a name is, right? But yet, you keep
reading these words, even though they&#8217;re not informative. For that matter, why
are we wasting space and ink printing this gibberish? </p>

<p>(2) Region and Card Type: Relics
are very rare items indeed. Only Magi from a Relic&#8217;s region can play that
Relic. </p>

<p>(3) Region Emblem: "Hand-forged
with pride in the </p>

<p>volcanoes of Cald."</p>

<p>(4) Energy Cost: Discard this
much energy from your Magi to play the card. Ka-ching!</p>

<p>(5) Artwork: Looks just like the
Relic&#8230; except the real Relic is more three-dimensional. </p>

<p>(6) Powers and Effects: This
tells you what the Relic does for you. Unlike Creatures (who use their own
energy), if the Relic&#8217;s Power has an energy cost, the Magi must pay that cost. </p>

<p>(7) Flavor Text: Also called
&#8216;color text&#8217; and &#8216;story stuff.&#8217;</p>

</td>
<td valign="top">

<p>(8) Rarity: No matter how common the card may be, the
relic itself is often a unique item. </p>

<p>(9) Artist Credits: "I may not
know art, but I know what I like," or so said Valkan about the Scroll of Fire.</p>

<h3>Spells</h3>

<p>Spells have a whirlwind-shaped
border around the artwork. Spells are single-use cards that represent an action
your Magi takes. Spells do a wide variety of things, from adding energy to your
Creatures to discarding cards from your opponent&#8217;s hand. </p>

<p>(1) Name: Often used as a verb:
"I shockwave your hyren."</p>

<p>(2) Region and Card Type: Spells
are not "from" the region the same way the Magi are, but Magi from certain
regions are better able to cast certain types of Spells. For example, Magi from
the Cald can cast their region&#8217;s fire-based Spells more easily than Magi from
anywhere else. </p>

<p>(3) Region Emblem: By the way,
did we mention we&#8217;ve made these cool enamel pins with these emblems? You oughta
check &#8217;em out on our web site. They&#8217;re available for Animite.</p>

<p>(4) Energy Cost: This is how
much energy your Magi must spend to play the Spell. As when you play Relics,
the energy is lost, but you&#8217;ll get some sort of worthy effect out of it.</p>

<p>(5) Artwork: Zap! Pow! Bif!</p>

<p>(6) Game Text: This tells you
what the Spell does. It is not considered either a Power or an Effect; those
come from Magi, Creatures, and Relics. </p>

<p>(7) Flavor Text: Mmmm. Tasty. </p>

<p>(8) Rarity: You know the spiel
by now. </p>

<p>(9) Artist Credits: These folks
did it. Plus their computers, the unsung heroes of the art world.</p>

<h3>The Other Stuff in the Box</h3>

<p>There&#8217;s some other stuff in your
box, too. Aside from all those oxygen and nitrogen molecules bouncing around,
that is. </p>

<p>Each deck box includes one six-sided
die. There are many cards in Magi-Nation that require a die roll, and we
thought you&#8217;d appreciate not having to go raid your backgammon game for dice. </p>

<p>Also, each deck has sheets of energy tokens. You can
use these to keep track of how much energy your Magi and your Creatures have.
Or, if you want, you can use dice, coins, jellybeans, glass beads, or a very
large litter of kittens instead.</p>

<h2>The Object of the Game</h2>

<p>In Magi-Nation, you defeat an
opponent&#8217;s Magi when you:</p>

<p>&#8226; discard all of that Magi&#8217;s Creatures
from play, AND </p>

<p>&#8226; remove all energy tokens from
that Magi.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll do this by using your own
Creatures and Spells to attack your opponent&#8217;s forces. When a Magi is defeated,
that player&#8217;s next Magi enters the fray. Defeat all three of your opponent&#8217;s Magi,
and you win!</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To start playing Magi-Nation
Duel, you need your enclosed deck and a friend with a deck to play against.
First separate all the Magi out of your deck. You&#8217;ll have at least three Magi.
If you have more, choose three of those to play with (for your first game, just
choose any three of the same region) and set the others aside; they will not be
used at this time. Shuffle the rest of your deck together. </p>

<h3>The Play Area</h3>

<p>Each player needs to have a
distinct location for their deck, their discard pile, their Creatures, and
their Magi and Relics. Here&#8217;s a diagram of how we like to set up our games here
at the office; use it if you like, or find something else that works for you. </p>

<h3>Selecting Magi</h3>

<p>At the start of the game, each
player chooses the order in which his or her Magi will appear. The Magi are
then placed face down in that order. The order cannot be changed once the game
starts. Remember that you will be drawing your Magi from the top of your Magi
stack, so make sure you have it set up right!</p>

<h3>Who Goes First?</h3>

<p>Once the order of the Magi has
been set, each player rolls a six-sided die (re-roll a tie). The player with
the higher roll gets to decide who goes first (some cards limit this choice).
If you are playing a multi-player game, play moves clockwise from the person
who goes first.</p>

<h2>The Steps of a Turn</h2>

<p>Each turn of Magi-Nation Duel flows through several
steps. Note that a "turn" is defined as you taking the steps of your turn only,
</p>

</td>
<td valign="top">

<p>not "once around the table," as
in some games. The six steps are:</p>

<p></p><ol>
<li>Energize 
        

</li><li>Powers/Relics/Spells 
        

</li><li>Attack 
        

</li><li>Play New Creatures 
        

</li><li>Powers/Relics/Spells 
        

</li><li>Draw</li>
</ol>
      <p></p>

<p><b>Your First Game:</b></p>

<p>Start!</p>

<p>The first player flips his or
her first Magi face up (we&#8217;ll assume it&#8217;s you). Look at the upper left-hand
corner of the Magi card to find the Magi&#8217;s Starting Energy, and place that
amount of energy on the Magi.</p>

<p>At the top of the Magi&#8217;s text
box, the word "STARTING" lists specific cards that this Magi begins the game
with. You may search your deck for any or all of those cards and put one copy
of each into your hand (shuffle your deck afterwards). Then, if this is your
first turn of the game, draw cards from your deck until you have a hand of
five.</p>

<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Energize</h3>

<p>At the top of your Magi&#8217;s text
box is his or her Energize number. This represents the amount of energy that
you put on your Magi during the Energize Step. Energize your Magi by putting
energy tokens onto him or her equal to the Magi&#8217;s Energize number. Any of your
other cards in play with an Energize number also get energized at this time. </p>

<p>Important Exception: The player
who goes first in the game does not energize on the first turn.</p>

<h3>Step 2 &#8211; Use Powers, Play Relics, and Play Spells</h3>

<p>This step also called the PRS
Step. In this step, you can use Powers, play Relics, or play Spells. </p>

<p>Every card has a Power, an
Effect, or both. You can use these in any order. For example, you may play a
Relic, then use a Power on it, then play another Relic, and then play a Spell.</p>

<p>Unlike Powers, you cannot choose
to use Effects. Effects tell you when they happen, and they happen
automatically. </p>

<p>Powers: If a card has the word "Power" in its text
box, that card can use that Power during this step. Each card can only use a
listed Power once per turn (not once per PRS Step).</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">Page 4</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" width="50%">

<p>Many Powers have an energy cost,
which appears as a number in a black circle. You must pay that cost before
using the power. If you use a Creature&#8217;s Power, remove the energy cost from the
Creature itself. If this leaves a Creature with no energy, it is immediately discarded
from play before the power takes effect, although the power still takes effect.</p>

<p>If you use your Magi&#8217;s Power or
a Relic&#8217;s Power, remove the energy from your Magi. If you don&#8217;t have enough
energy to pay for a particular Power, you can&#8217;t use it. However, you can use
all of your Magi&#8217;s energy to pay for a Power. This does not defeat your Magi
(but the Magi still gets defeated if he or she has no creatures in play after
the Power resolves). </p>

<p>Relics: If you play a Relic, it
has an energy cost associated with it, located in the upper left-hand corner of
the card. </p>

<p>You cannot play or otherwise
gain a Relic if your Magi already has a card with that name (or an alternate)
in play. You can play a Relic that an opponent&#8217;s Magi has in play. </p>

<p>Additionally, you may only play
Universal Relics or Relics from your Magi&#8217;s region. You may not play Relics
from other Regions.</p>

<p>Spells: To play a Spell, look at
the Spell card&#8217;s upper left-hand corner to see its energy cost. Remove that
much energy from your Magi. Do whatever the Spell says and discard it.</p>

<p>Spells from regions other than
your Magi&#8217;s region cost 1 additional energy.</p>

<p>Example: You have Vortex of
Knowledge in your hand. It&#8217;s a 1-energy Spell that says, "Each player draws two
cards." You play the Spell, remove one energy from your Magi, and you and your
opponent(s) each draw two cards. </p>

<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Attack! </h3>

<p>If you have Creatures, you can
have them attack your opponent&#8217;s Creatures or Magi. </p>

<p>Select one of your Creatures to
be the attacker, and one of your opponent&#8217;s Creatures to be the defender.
Resolve any Effects that activate on an attack. </p>

<p>Note the energy totals of both
Creatures. Each Creature simultaneously removes the number of energy tokens it
has from the opposing Creature. Any Creatures that reach zero energy are defeated,
and are immediately discarded.</p>

<p>Example: A Quor at four energy attacks a Leaf Hyren at
five energy. The Quor removes four tokens from the Hyren while the Hyren
removes five from the Quor. The Quor is left </p>

</td>
<td valign="top">

<p>with no energy (4 - 5 =      
everything it has) and is discarded from play. The Hyren is left with one
energy (5 - 4 = 1).</p>

<p>While you can only attack once
with each of your Creatures, you can attack the same defending Creature more
than once by using multiple Creatures in separate attacks.</p>

<p>If your opponent has no
Creatures left, you can attack his or her Magi directly. When a Creature
attacks a Magi, see how many energy tokens are on the Creature and remove that
many from the Magi. The Magi does not remove tokens from the Creature.
Attacking an opposing Magi counts as the Creature&#8217;s attack for the turn.</p>

<h3>Step 4 &#8211; Play New Creatures</h3>

<p>After you have finished
attacking, you may play Creatures from your hand. Because this step takes place
after the Attack step, Creatures you bring in now won&#8217;t be able to attack this
turn, but they will be able to use powers in the next step.</p>

<p>Look at the upper left-hand
corner of the Creature card to see how much energy it takes to play that
Creature (this is also known as the Creature&#8217;s starting energy). Place the
Creature in front of you (face up), pay the energy cost from your Magi, and
give the Creature energy tokens equal to its cost. These energy tokens now
represent the Creature&#8217;s strength. </p>

<p>Most often you can simply move
the Creature&#8217;s starting energy from your Magi to the Creature, to make things
easier. </p>

<p>You may play as many Creatures
as you have in your hand that you have enough energy to pay for. You cannot
play a Creature if your Magi does not have enough energy to pay for the
Creature. </p>

<p>Just like Spells, Dream Creatures
from regions other than your Magi&#8217;s cost 1 additional energy.</p>

<h3>Step 5 &#8211; Use Powers, Play Relics, and Cast Spells</h3>

<p>This is the same as the previous
Powers/Relic/Spells Step. For this step of the game, you may have new Creatures
that weren&#8217;t around during the first PRS Step, and you can now use their
Powers. Remember that cards can only use a listed Power once each turn, not
once each step.</p>

<h3>Step 6 &#8211; Draw</h3>

<p>Draw two cards from your deck. If your deck has run
out and you can&#8217;t draw your two </p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">Page 5</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" width="50%">

<p>cards, shuffle your discard pile
to make a new deck. This is the only time you can reshuffle your deck, and you
may only do so once per turn.</p>

<p>Your turn ends.</p>

<h3>That&#8217;s It!</h3>

<p>Now your opponent begins his or
her turn, following all of the steps that you just followed, including flipping
up a new Magi and building a starting hand. </p>

<p>In exchange for going second,
your opponent gets to energize on his or her first turn.</p>

<h2>A Few More Rules</h2>

<h3>Breaking the Rules</h3>

<p>As in any CCG, some cards have
text that seems to break the rules. Card text always takes precedence over
these game rules. For example, a Relic may allow a Creature to attack more than
once a turn. This seems to break a rule, but since the card specifically allows
it, the Creature can attack more often than normal. This may be hard to get
used to, but you&#8217;ll find it adds variety and makes the game much more fun!</p>

<h3>The Magi</h3>

<p>Magi are the focus of your game;
you want to preserve yours while defeating those of the other player(s). </p>

<p>Before your first turn of the
game, flip your first Magi face up. Then you search your deck for whichever of
that Magi&#8217;s starting cards you wish to have in your hand. These include the
starting cards printed on the Magi, plus any cards that say in the text box
that your Magi may start with that card (for example, the card Sorreah&#8217;s Dream
says, "STARTING: Sorreah," so it&#8217;s one of Sorreah&#8217;s starting cards). Finally,
if you have less than five cards, draw until you have a starting hand of five
cards. </p>

<p>Slightly different rules apply
when your Magi gets defeated in the middle of a game. When one of your Magi is
defeated, immediately place it face up at the bottom of your Magi stack. All of
the cards that the defeated Magi had in play are discarded. All Spells that
your opponent(s) had that affected your defeated Magi will not affect your new
Magi.</p>

<p>Until your next turn, your next Magi remains face down
on your Magi stack. Your Magi cannot be attacked and is not affected by Spells,
Powers, or Effects while face down.</p>

</td>
<td valign="top">

<p>At the start of your next turn,
before you do anything else, turn over your next Magi from the top of the
stack. Your new Magi begins with energy equal to his or her Starting Energy.</p>

<p>Next, you can retrieve any or
all of that Magi&#8217;s starting cards. Go through your discard pile first, and
then, if necessary, search your deck for the cards. You may look for a specific
card even if you already have another copy of that card in your hand. However,
if you cannot find a specific card, you do not draw cards as a substitute.
Also, you do not draw extra cards as you did at the start of the game. Your
turn now begins. </p>

<p>Your new Magi will energize on
his or her first turn.</p>

<p>If your second Magi is defeated,
play your third as above. When all of a player&#8217;s Magi are defeated, that player
loses.</p>

<h4>Alternate Magi</h4>

<p>Magi-Nation is both a game and a
story, and just as characters in a story grow and change, so too will your
favorite Magi. You&#8217;ll see these changes as we print new versions of these Magi.
These Magi will either have the Magi&#8217;s name in their card title, or they&#8217;ll
have the keyword "Alternate" in their Card Type line (below their card name),
followed by the name of the Magi the card represents.</p>

<p>For example, in the period of
time covered by the Dream&#8217;s End expansion, the Magi Evu became corrupted by the
power of the Core. We printed a card named "Evil Evu," which is treated as the
same card as Evu. We might also print an even later version of Evu, named "The
Dark Avenger," with the text "Alternate Evu" to indicate that it counts as Evu.</p>

<p>Magi and their alternates count
as the same person for all purposes. Therefore you could not have both Evu and
Evil Evu in your Magi stack. Likewise, a Plith, which gives a card-draw bonus
to Evu, also gives that bonus to other versions of Evu. </p>

<h4>Double Magi Cards</h4>

<p>The Awakening expansion
introduced the card, "Korg &amp; Zet," our first double-Magi card. </p>

<p>Double Magi count as if they
were all named and alternate-keyword Magi for purposes of deck construction as
well as other effects. They also count as two Magi for purposes of </p>

<p>victory. Thus, when building a deck with "Korg &amp;
Zet," you can have only one other Magi in your stack who is neither Korg nor
Zet, and </p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">Page 6</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" width="50%">

<p>when those two cards (which
represent three Magi) are defeated, you lose.</p>

<p>In tournament play, you may wish
to conceal the fact that you have only two cards in your Magi stack. If so,
place a Universal Relic at the bottom of your Magi stack. If you use opaque
card sleeves, you can instead use a card placed backwards. Either way, it still
looks like you have three cards, though you will of course lose if your two
Magi cards are defeated. This extra card in no way counts as part of your
deck.</p>

<h4>Core and Shadow Magi</h4>

<p>The Region called the Core is
different from the other Regions. The Magi from the Core come in two varieties,
noted right below their name: Core Magi and Shadow Magi. Core Magi dwell in the
Core of the moon and have done so for thousands of years. Shadow Magi once
lived in one of the regions of the Moonlands, but have become corrupted by the
nefarious power of the Core.</p>

<p>Core Magi can play Universal cards,
and they can play Core cards, but they cannot play cards from any other region.
Shadow Magi act as Core Magi, but they may also play a few select cards from
their original region. These cards have text that clearly indicates this (for
example, the last line in the text box of the card "Deadfall" says, "Naroom
Shadow Magi may play Deadfall"). Since they are now no longer members of their
original region, Shadow Magi must pay the regional penalty to play such
non-Core cards.</p>

<p>Conversely, the magic of the Core
is by and large incompatible with the dreams of normal Magi. Magi from regions
other than the Core cannot play any Core cards unless the card&#8217;s text
specifically says that they can. Those few Core cards that can be played by
other Magi also exact the regional penalty of one additional energy from
non-Core Magi.</p>

<p>Regions</p>

<p>Every card has a specific region
(or regions) that it is from. Yes, Universal is considered a region, but it has
special rules. Some cards have two regions; treat these cards as if they were
from both regions. Magi have certain restrictions based on the region(s) they
are from. </p>

<h4>Regional Penalty</h4>

<p>Magi that play a Creature or Spell from a different
region must pay one extra energy to play that card. This is called a regional
penalty. In the case of a Creature, the extra energy does </p>

</td>
<td valign="top">

<p>not go onto the Creature; it is
discarded. Likewise, the regional penalty does not count towards energy used to
cast a Spell. </p>

<p>Example: an Orothe Magi wants to
play a Lightning Hyren an Arderial Creature that costs 5 energy. To do so, she
must spend 6 energy, 5 for the Creature and 1 more for the regional penalty.
Only 5 energy would go onto the Lightning Hyren; the regional penalty energy is
discarded. </p>

<p>Relics do not incur a regional
penalty, but they also have a regional restriction (see below). </p>

<p>Regional Restriction</p>

<p>Regional restrictions prevent
you from playing certain cards. The restriction on Core Magi using non-Core
cards (and vice versa) is a regional restriction. </p>

<p>Relics also have a regional
restriction. Magi can not play Relics that are from a different region. For
instance, a Naroom Magi could not play a Cald Relic. However, if a Magi somehow
gets a Relic from a different region in play, he or she can use the abilities
on that card. Similarly, if a card&#8217;s text removes the regional restriction, the
regional penalty still doesn&#8217;t apply. </p>

<h4>Universal Cards</h4>

<p>Universal cards are an exception
to the normal regional penalty rules. Any Magi can use these cards, ignoring
all regional restrictions or penalties. </p>

<p>Universal Magi do not get to use
everything at cost, though. Universal is considered its own region, so
Universal Magi must pay a regional penalty for any card they play outside their
region. </p>

<p>Dual-Region Cards</p>

<p>Several cards belong to two
regions. These dual-regions cards are actually very easy to use. Dual-region
cards belong to both regions equally, and count as being in both regions for
all purposes. </p>

<p>Example: The Flame Rudwot is a dual-region Naroom/Cald
Creature. A Naroom Magi can play a Flame Rudwot without paying a regional
penalty, because it is (in part) a Naroom Creature. Firefly Swarm, a Cald Spell
that you can only play on non-Cald Creatures, cannot affect the Flame Rudwot,
because it is partly a Cald Creature, even though it is also partly from Naroom.

<h3>Fiddly Bits</h3>

<h4>Variable Cards</h4>

<p>Some cards use "X" as part of
the cost to play the card. In these cases, "X" is a variable; it can be any
number you want it to be (and have enough energy to pay for), even zero. </p>

<p>Example: Your opponent has a
Creature with three energy and you want to get rid of it. You have Thunderquake
in your hand; a Spell that costs X energy to play and removes X energy from any
combination of Creatures. To remove three energy with Thunderquake, X must
equal three. You play the Spell and take three energy off of your Underneath
Magi. This means that you can remove three energy from the Creature, leaving it
with no energy and causing it to be discarded.</p>

<p>If for some reason X is not
specified, it is assumed to be equal to zero. When X is zero, then any Effects
that normally activate from that X do not apply. </p>

<p>Example: Scroll of Fire has an
Effect that discards an additional energy from a Creature whenever you play a
Spell that discards energy from that Creature. If you make X equal to 0 on
Thunderquake, the Scroll of Fire&#8217;s Effect will not activate from that zero.</p>

<h4>Building Your Deck</h4>

<p>Building a deck is one of the
most important aspects of Magi-Nation. Each deck must have at least 40 non-Magi
cards, and your Magi stack must have exactly three different Magi. </p>

<p>You cannot have more than one
copy of any Magi. Players can choose any Magi from any region to make their
decks; they can even use Magi from different regions in the same deck.</p>

<p>You may not have more than three
copies of any given card in your deck. In the region and card type line,
certain cards say that they are "Alternate" versions of another card (i.e.,
Dark Furok says, "Alternate Furok"). When building or playing your deck, Furok
and Dark Furok count as the same card in all ways. You cannot have more than
three total of those two cards in your deck, and actions that affect one card
affect its alternates. </p>

<h4>Searching Your Deck</h4>

<p>Whenever you look through your deck for a card,
reshuffle your deck afterwards. If you are searching for a specific card or
card type, you must show it to your opponent when you have found it. If you are
looking for "any" card or </p>

</td>
<td valign="top">

<p>cards, then you do not have to
show the card(s) to your opponent.</p>

<h4>Spells Remaining in Play</h4>

<p>The text of some Spells requires
you to leave the Spell card in play for a specified number of turns. In these
special circumstances, place the Spell near the card it affects (or place it
where the text directs). At the end of the last turn the Spell is to stay in
effect, place the Spell in your discard pile. Note that a Spell only needs to
stay in play if the card actually instructs you to place it somewhere in play.
If a Spell only specifies that some Spell-generated effect apply for a certain
number of turns, the Spell card itself is discarded as normal.</p>

<h4>Effects</h4>

<p>All Effects specify when they
activate. Effects can activate from many parts of the game, or from individual
player actions. This creates a small window of time when the action specified
by the Effect is legal to play. If one of your Effects activates in this way,
just follow the instructions on the card, performing any appropriate actions,
and then continue with the game. </p>

<p>Effects that use the word "may"
or contain options for the owner that may change what happens as a result of
the Effect; however activating all Effects is mandatory.</p>

<h4>The Name Rule</h4>

<p>If a Spell or Effect says it
affects a specific Creature type, it affects any Creature with that word in its
name. Thus a Power that discards all Quors affects Stone Quors and Quor Pups,
too. </p>

<h4>Energize Rates</h4>

<p>Energize Rates do not stack. A
Creature with Energize 1 that gains Energize 2 only has Energize 2, not
Energize 3.</p>

<p>Three or More Players</p>

<p>If you play with three or more
players, the person who goes first does get to energize, unlike in a two-player
game. Also, players can attack the Creatures of any player whenever they
attack; you don&#8217;t need to attack just one player.</p>

<h4>Other Important Points</h4>

<p>Once you start a step, you can&#8217;t
go back to a previous step. </p>

<p>You cannot play anything during your opponent&#8217;s turn unless
a card specifically allows </p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">Page 8</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" width="50%">

<p>you to. For the most part, only
Effects allow you to do anything on your opponent&#8217;s turn. If one of your
Effects is activated on someone else&#8217;s turn, do whatever the card tells you to
and nothing else.</p>

<p>You cannot move energy between
your cards unless a Spell, Effect or Power lets you do so.</p>

<p>There are few limits in
Magi-Nation Duel. You can have as many cards in your hand as you want.
Creatures and Magi have no limit on their energy. Magi have no limit on cards
in play. </p>

<h2>Example of Play</h2>

<p>Alan and Zoe sit down to play a
game. Alan has a Naroom deck and Zoe has a Cald deck (all cards used in this
example can be found in those decks). Alan ends up going first. </p>

<h3>Alan, Turn 1</h3>

<p>Alan flips up Pruitt, his first
Magi. Pruitt&#8217;s card says, "STARTING: Vinoc, Carillion, Grow." Alan searches his
deck, chooses to grab a Carillion and a Grow, and shows them to Zoe. He
shuffles his deck, and, since he didn&#8217;t take a Vinoc, draws three more cards to
bring his starting hand to five. Finally, the number in the upper left-hand
corner of Pruitt&#8217;s card is 15, so he places 15 points&#8217; worth of energy tokens
on her.</p>

<p><b>Step 1 &#8211; Energize</b></p>

<p>Since he went first, he does not energize Pruitt. </p>

<p><b>Step 2 &#8211; Powers, Relics, Spells</b></p>

<p>Alan has a Spell named Vortex of
Knowledge in his hand, and he plays it. It has a cost of 1, so he discards 1
energy from Pruitt. The card says, "Each player draws two cards," so both Alan
and Zoe draw two cards (these are Zoe&#8217;s first two cards).</p>

<p>Alan has no Relics, and Pruitt
can&#8217;t use her Power without a Creature to use it on. He has no more Spells he
wishes to play. </p>

<p><b>Step 3 &#8211; Attack</b></p>

<p>Alan has no Creatures to attack
with, so he skips this step. </p>

<p><b>Step 4 &#8211; Play New Creatures</b></p>

<p>Alan plays a Carillion. It has a
starting energy of 4, so he moves 4 energy from Pruitt to the Carillion. Pruitt
now has 10 energy. </p>

<p>Alan also plays a Weebo (2
energy) and a Furok (4 energy), reducing Pruitt to 4 energy. </p>

<p><b>Step 5 &#8211; Powers, Relics, Spells</b></p>

<p>Alan uses Pruitt&#8217;s Power. It costs two energy but
allows her to add three energy to any </p>

</td>
<td valign="top">

<p>Creature. He spends two energy
from Pruitt (dropping her to two), and adds 3 energy to her Weebo (bringing it
to 5). He chooses not to use any other Powers. </p>

<p><b>Step 6 &#8211; Draw</b></p>

<p>Alan draws his cards; he now has
five cards in his hand. He indicates his turn is over. </p>

<p><b>Zoe, Turn 1</b></p>

<p>Zoe flips up Grega, her first
Magi. Her card says, "Starting: Arbolit, Quor Pup, Fire Flow." Zoe looks
through her deck, pulls those three cards, and shows them to Alan. Then, as she
already has five cards in her hand (she drew two during Alan&#8217;s turn), she
doesn&#8217;t draw any extra, but simply shuffles her deck.</p>

<p>Grega&#8217;s starting energy is 10, so
Zoe puts 10 energy on her.</p>

<p><b>Step 1 &#8211; Energize</b></p>

<p>Zoe did not go first, so she gets
to energize Grega. Grega&#8217;s energize number is five, so Zoe ups her energy to
15.</p>

<p><b>Step 2 &#8211; Powers,
Relics, Spells</b></p>

<p>As her special Power, Grega can
launch a thermal blast, costing her two energy. Zoe discards two energy from
Grega. The Power says, "Roll one die. Choose any one Creature or Magi in play.
Discard energy equal to the die roll from the chosen Creature or Magi." Zoe
rolls the die and gets a 4. Since Pruitt can use her own Power to add energy to
Creatures, effectively healing them, Zoe decides to choose the Furok (4 energy)
instead of the Weebo (5 energy). The Furok loses all its energy and is
discarded (and therefore can&#8217;t be healed by Pruitt). </p>

<p>Zoe has no more Spells, Relics,
or Powers she wants to use. </p>

<p><b>Step 3 &#8211; Attack</b></p>

<p>Since Zoe has no Creatures in
play at this time, she skips her attack step. </p>

<p><b>Step 4 &#8211; Play New
Creatures</b></p>

<p>Zoe plays her Arbolit, Quor Pup,
and Lava Balamant, for a total of 8 energy, which she moves onto the
appropriate Creatures. Grega now has 5 energy left. </p>

<p><b>Step 5 &#8211; Powers,
Relics, Spells</b></p>

<p>Thanks to its Effect, Alan&#8217;s
Carillion can crush tiny Creatures in an attack without losing any energy. To
counter this, Zoe uses the Arbolit&#8217;s Power. The Arbolit&#8217;s Power says, "Choose
any one Creature in play. Discard Arbolit from play. Add two energy to the
chosen Creature." She discards the Arbolit and adds two more energy to the Quor
Pup.</p>

<p>Finally, she plays a Fireball Spell. It costs her two
energy but discards two energy from a Creature. She removes two energy from the
</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">Page 9</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" width="50%">

<p>Carillion, dropping it to 2
energy. She discards the Fireball card.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, she can&#8217;t use
Grega&#8217;s Power again this turn. </p>

<p><b>Step 6 &#8211; Draw </b></p>

<p>Zoe draws her two cards and ends
her turn. </p>

<p><b>Alan, Turn 2</b></p>

<p><b>Step 1 &#8211; Energize</b></p>

<p>Alan adds five energy to Pruitt,
bringing her to 7.</p>

<p><b>Step 2 &#8211; Powers,
Relics, Spells</b></p>

<p>Alan uses Pruitt&#8217;s Power. He
spends 2 energy and adds 3 to the Carillion. Now Pruitt and the Carillion each
have 5 energy. </p>

<p>Alan plays the Spell Tap Roots.
This allows him to discard up to 2 energy from any creature, and add up to 2
energy to any other Creature. He takes 2 energy from Zoe&#8217;s Lava Balamant and
adds 2 energy to his Weebo. Now the Lava Balamant has 3 energy, and the Weebo
has 7. That&#8217;s a big Weebo.</p>

<p><b>Step 3 &#8211; Attack</b></p>

<p>The big honkin&#8217; Weebo then goes
forth and attacks the hapless Lava Balamant. The Lava Balamant removes 3 energy
from the Weebo, leaving it with 4. The Weebo removes all the Lava Balamant&#8217;s
energy, and the Balamant gets discarded.</p>

<p>Next, Alan&#8217;s Carillion attacks
the Quor Pup. The Carillion has 5 energy and the Quor Pup has 4, so the
Carillion removes all the Quor Pup&#8217;s energy (discarding it) and the Quor Pup
leaves the Carillion with 1.</p>

<p><b>Step 4 &#8211; Play New
Creatures</b></p>

<p>Alan chooses not to play any new
Creatures; he&#8217;s saving up to pay for the Giant Carillion in his hand (which
costs 8). </p>

<p><b>Step 5 &#8211; Powers,
Relics, Spells</b></p>

<p>Alan uses the Weebo&#8217;s Power. It
costs the Weebo 2 energy, but brings the Carillion back to its starting energy
of 4. </p>

<p><b>Step 6 &#8211; Draw</b></p>

<p>Alan&#8217;s turn is now over, and he
feels pretty good. But then Zoe starts to grin evilly&#8230;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Glossary</b></p>

<p>Add: Raising the energy level on
a card already in play. The energy comes from nowhere (or "the bank" if you
prefer). The only exception is cards that specifically use some form of the
word "rearrange" in describing their action(s); </p>

<p>rearranging is not considered to
add to remove energy.</p>

</td>
<td valign="top">

<p>Attack: An attack is when one player&#8217;s Creature fights
with another player&#8217;s Creature. The full explanation of an attack given covers
all </p>

<p>aspects of an attack, and not
all of these steps apply to every attack. In most cases, you can use the
simplified attack scheme described in the rulebook.</p>

<p>Attacking Step Order:</p>

<p></p><ol>
<li>Attacking player declares one attacking 
        Creature. 
        
</li><li>Attacking player declares one defending Creature 
        or Magi. 
        
</li><li>Note energy levels of all Creatures for purposes 
        of processing Effects. This energy level will be locked in for the rest 
        of the attack. 
        
</li><li>Process Effects using the numbers from Step 3. 
        
</li><li>After Step 4 is resolved, if any new Effects are 
        now activated, go back to Step 4. Remember to use the numbers from Step 
        3 in all cases. A Creature cannot gain bonuses from any one Effect more 
        than once per attack. 
        
</li><li>Lock in attacking and defending energy levels 
        for the attack resolution. 
        
</li><li>Resolve energy loss in attack. Effects may apply 
        here as well. Creatures simultaneously remove their energy from Step 6 
        from the opposing Creature. Any Creature reaching zero energy at this 
        point is defeated and discarded. 
        
</li><li>Process any applicable end-of-attack Effects.</li>
</ol>
      <p></p>

<p>Note
that some Powers may activate in a manner like Effects in the above sequence,
and should be handled as if they were Effects.</p>

<p>Burrowed: A lot of Underneath
cards refer to Creatures that are "burrowed." Being burrowed is a special
condition granted by various cards. Creatures that are burrowed do not lose
more than two total energy per turn due to attacks or opposing cards. </p>

<p>Deck: Your deck contains the 40
or more cards that you play with, including Creatures, Spells, and Relics. Your
deck specifically excludes your Magi, which are called your Magi stack. You may
not have more than three copies of a given card in your deck. </p>

<p>Defeat: A Creature is defeated
when it has no energy tokens left on it. A Magi is defeated when he or she has
no energy tokens and all of his or her Creatures are defeated.</p>

<p>Defend: A Creature that is being
attacked is defending.</p>

<p>Discard (Cards): Always discard
from your hand unless:</p>

<p></p><ol>
<li>The text says discard "from play," 
        
</li><li>With logical interpretation, the text implies 
        from play (i.e., the Creature&#8217;s Power says to discard itself), or 
        
</li><li>The text refers to a specific non-Spell card type and does not refer to discarding
from a hand (e.g. "Discard all Balamants").</li>
</ol>
      <p></p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">Page 10</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" width="50%">

<p>Note that when your Magi is defeated you only need to discard your cards that are in
play, not those in your hand.</p>

<p>Also, "discard from play" refers only to cards that go from play to your discard pile
(even if only momentarily), and to Magi that are defeated and go to your Magi
stack (face up).</p>

<p>Discard (Energy): This means to
remove energy from the card and the game (it gets put in "the bank," if you
like).</p>

<p>Effect: Effects are abilities
printed on Magi, Creatures, and Relics. Some Effects occur automatically (like
at the start of each of your turns), some are activated by other game actions
(such as playing a Creature or using a Power), and some Effects protect cards
from game actions (such as Spells or Powers or other Effects).</p>

<p>When an Effect meets the conditions specified in its description, it is "activated."
Play the actions in the Effect as specified, then continue with the game.
Effects with "may" in them have results that depend in part on whether the
player in question opts to use the Effect or not. Other Effects are mandatory;
they do not use the word "may."</p>

<p>The player whose turn it is chooses the order of his or her Effects, and applies
all of them in that order. Then his or her opponent(s) do the same in turn. </p>

<p>Foils: Foils are shiny cards,
and are especially prized by </p>

<p>collectors. They are very rare
and hard to find. See the packaging for odds on finding a foil.</p>

<p>Largest: The Creature(s) with
the most energy tokens on it. This has nothing to do with starting energy. </p>

<p>Magi: Magi are powerful wizards
from the different regions of the Moonlands. They are the main characters in
any duel. </p>

<p>Magi Stack: This is the pile of
three Magi with which you play the game. The Magi are revealed in order; i.e.,
your second Magi is not revealed until the first is defeated. </p>

<p>Opponent: Any card that says
"opponent" on it refers to any other player besides you. </p>

<p>Opposing: A card controlled or
an action generated by any player other than you. </p>

<p>Play: Whenever you play a card, it is treated the same
way. Thus if you are somehow able to play a Creature during your PRS step, you
must </p>

</td>
<td valign="top">

<p>still pay the energy cost and
any regional penalty. </p>

<p>Power: Many of the Magi, Relics,
and Creatures have Powers. Each Power has a specific cost. Below is the order
of steps to use when playing a Power. Keep in mind that this was developed to
cover all aspects of using a Power, and not all portions of these steps will
apply to every Power. In most cases you may use the simplified instructions
described in the general rules.</p>

<p></p><ol>
<li>Announce that you are using the Power. 
        
</li><li>Pay all costs associated with that Power such as 
        energy loss and/or discarding the source Creature. These costs occur and 
        are paid simultaneously. 
        
</li><li>Check to see if any Creatures have reached zero 
        energy. If they have, discard them from play. If the source Creature is 
        discarded at this point, the Power still continues to operate. 
        
</li><li>Make all choices involved. If there is no longer 
        a valid card to choose, then the Power ceases. If a Power requires you 
        to discard a Creature, choose it now. 
        
</li><li>Simultaneously carry out all results of the 
        Power, including discarding any Creatures selected in the previous step. 

        
</li><li>Discard any Creatures that have zero energy. 
        
</li><li>Check to see if any Magi have reached zero energy. If they have,
and they have no Creatures in play, they are defeated. </li>
</ol>
      <p></p>

<p>Note that Magi are not checked for zero energy until the entire Power has resolved.
This is also true when Magi play Spells.</p>

<p>Rearrange: Taking energy from
one card and placing it on another card, neither adding nor reducing the total
amount of energy on the board. </p>

<p>Regional Penalty: An extra cost
for using cards from a region different from the Magi&#8217;s region. </p>

<p>Regions: The place(s) that the
card comes from or is most common to. There are many different regions in
Magi-Nation. Orothe and Orothe Deep are synonymous.</p>

<p>Remove: see Discard. </p>

<p>Restore: Restoring can add or
discard energy from a Creature, unless otherwise restricted (see Magam), until
it is at the desired energy level (generally its starting energy level).</p>

<p>Reveal: Show a card to all
players and allow them to read its full text. </p>

<p>Self-Referential: Some powers and effects refer by
name to the specific card that has the power. For example, Timber Hyren has a
power that says, "Take up to five energy from your </p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2" align="center">Page 11</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" width="50%">

<p>Magi and place it on Timber
Hyren." If copied, the copied power refers instead to the card that gains the
power. </p>

<p>Smallest: The Creature(s) with
the least energy tokens on it. This has nothing to do with starting energy. </p>

<p>Universal: Universal is
considered a region, although Magi can play Universal Relics. They can also
play Universal Spells and Creatures without paying a regional penalty.</p>

<p>Winning: To win, all Magi
belonging to all other players in the game must be defeated. If a Magi ever has
no energy tokens and no Creatures in play, that Magi is defeated and goes to
the bottom of the Magi stack face up. When all three of a player&#8217;s Magi are
defeated, that player loses the game.</p>
