1. Introduction to the Digest<br>
<br>
This is the first ever Magi-Nation Duel Rules Digest, covering rules<br>
questions from about the beginning of February through 2/7/02. Above you see<br>
the contents list for this digest; contents will appear at the top of every<br>
Rules Digest. Below are the rules answers, separated by numbered lines.<br>
Rules Digests will appear daily (weekdays only) and thus will usually be<br>
much shorter than this digest, which covers an entire week's worth of<br>
questions. Each Monday's digest will cover any questions posted over the<br>
preceding weekend.<br>
<br>
What does the Rules Digest mean for you?<br>
<br>
- Questions posted will be addressed in the Rules Digest for the day they<br>
are posted. This means they will not be answered as soon as they are posted.<br>
(REMINDER: The Rules Team encourages all list members to thoroughly search<br>
the forum archives and the rules site at www.magiduel.com for answers to<br>
their questions to limit repeat queries.)<br>
<br>
- Please DO NOT ANSWER RULES QUESTIONS ON THE LIST. Even if you have the<br>
exact quoted text from a former post by a Rules Rep., please RESIST THE URGE<br>
to press Reply and post it immediately. If you must, reply directly to the<br>
person who posed the question. Note that this is a BIG CHANGE from the old<br>
policy. (On a related note: If you see someone else answering rules<br>
questions and violating this policy please, PLEASE don't post your short<br>
one-lind reprimand - chances are we have it covered and they have a nice<br>
polite reminder of this list policy in their Inbox already.)<br>
<br>
- If you have a rules question to post, please put [RULES] in the subject<br>
field (as is noted at the top of each digest). This way we'll be sure to<br>
pick it out of the numerous list posts for inclusion in the Rules Digest. No<br>
guarantees on getting rules questions into the Digest without this tag.<br>
Also, when quoting the cards you are discussing, please check<br>
www.magi-nation.com/duel for the latest card texts.<br>
<br>
- If you must have an answer immediately, send the question to<br>
tyles@... with [RULES] in the title. You are more likely to get<br>
an answer immediately, and worst case scenario your question will still get<br>
added to that day's Rules Digest for public consumption.<br>
<br>
- If you have a question posted prior to February 1st (or if we happen to<br>
miss your rules post), please resubmit it to the list for inclusion in the<br>
next Rules Digest.<br>
<br>
- If you respond to the Rules Digest please only quote the specific section<br>
you are responding to.<br>
<br>
- Playtesters: Only rules questions posted to the main list will be answered<br>
in the Rules Digest.<br>
<br>

On to the rules questions...<br>

2. Starting Cards<br>

><br>
>If my deck has multiple cards that CAN be Starting Cards can I draw<br>
>all of those cards into my hand?<br>
<br>
<br>
Each Magi's listed starting cards can only be retrieved once. For example,<br>
if your Magi has listed "Starting: Eebit, Weebo, Grow" you can only get one<br>
Eebit, one Weebo, and one Grow. Remember that non-Magi cards that have<br>
"Starting: <Magi Name>" on them are simply edits to the Magi's starting card<br>
list. When Krawg says "Starting: Ashgar," that just means that Ashgar now<br>
has Krawg added to his starting card list. So you can only get a single<br>
Krawg as a starting card for Ashgar; you can't retrieve all the Krawgs<br>
you're playing with.<br>
<br>

3. Shadow Cloak & Shell<br>

http://www.magi-nation.com/duel/Awakening/corrupt.jpg<br>
<br>
The Shell would protect the next Creature played (assuming it's Orothe) from<br>
the Corrupt (which would get discarded per its instructions anyway). Shadow<br>
Cloak would work except for the fact that Corrupt is a Core Spell...<br>
<br>
So the general rule here is that yes, these protective cards apply to<br>
Creatures that may come into play later while the protective card is still<br>
applying.<br>

In fact you *must* process Deluge since it will still be the same part of<br>
your turn, and Voda's Deluge is not optional.<br>

Pertinent Card:<br>
http://www.magi-nation.com/duel/Awakening/furok_guardian.jpg<br>
<br>
You can use Furok Guardian's Effect as many times a turn as you have energy<br>
for. If you have a 15 energy F. Guardian and three of your other Creatures<br>
are discarded from play (one at a time), you could discard 5e for each<br>
Creature and they'd all come back at the end of the turn. The Guardian would<br>
of course have no energy left, so would be discarded. Since the Creature<br>
comes back at the end of the turn, it couldn't really use a Power then<br>
(since it's not the Powers/Relics/Spells Step); however, if it could use a<br>
Power, yes, you'd be able to use the Power again - the Creature is<br>
considered a new version of the same Creature since it left play.<br>
<br>
A reminder that Furok Guardian's Terra Rebirth activates only on single<br>
discards, not on multiple discards. It wouldn't work on a Tidal Wave<br>
discarding two of your Creatures, for example. So in the example above,<br>
we're assuming three separate instances of discard (like a Shockwave, an<br>
Undertow, and a Giant Carillion, for instance).<br>

<br>
You can only play Relics if you don't have a *card* in play with the same<br>
name. Creature, Relic, Spell - doesn't matter if it has the same name. If<br>
you're trying to play a Relic, you can't if another card you control has the<br>
same name.<br>

http://www.magi-nation.com/duel/Awakening/abwyns_quill.jpg<br>
<br>
1. Choosing a region doesn't cause that choice to appear in print on the<br>
card (where it would be affected by Weave Twist). Your assumption is<br>
correct.<br>
<br>
2. Ashio's Weave Twist checks on the reference constantly - if you changed<br>
it with Quill, the W. Twist would immediately change it back.<br>
<br>
3. Yes, and as stated in #2, the Twist would change it back immediately.<br>

Per the text on Evil Evu, you draw a card even when reducing an opposing<br>
Creature to zero energy. This includes attacking and energy-discarding<br>
actions like Syphon Stone.<br>

<br>
Pertinent Card:<br>
http://www.magi-nation.com/duel/dreamsend/cards/hrada.jpg<br>
<br>
Tainted Touch only allows the Magi to play Creatures and Spells; essentially<br>
one side effect of T.T. is that the Magi is cut off from playing their<br>
original region's Relics as they normally would have. Now, some of the<br>
Relics you're playing with may allow your region's Shadow Magi to play them,<br>
so may still be playable under T.T.<br>

"No, it's there at the website, under General Gameplay Rulings -> Discard<br>
Pile:<br>
<br>
'* During your Draw Step, if you are required to draw one or more cards and<br>
there are none left in your deck, immediately shuffle your discard pile into<br>
your deck and draw the remaining cards as needed. You may only recirculate<br>
your discard into your deck in this manner once per turn.<br>
<br>
If you need to draw from an empty deck a second time during your Draw Step,<br>
or if you need to do so for any reason outside your Draw Step, you simply do<br>
not get to draw the needed cards. There is no penalty for not being able to<br>
draw in these situations, nor do any Effects that normally are activated<br>
upon drawing a card come into play. [RT 05/11/01]'<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if or why this part of the gameplay was left out of the most<br>
current rulebook (don't have a copy with me handy), but I know it will<br>
definitely be in the next one.<br>

For now, play as the ruling at MagiDuel.com states (as Steve quoted above) -<br>
you can recirculate at any time in your turn, but once you have recirculated<br>
once, you may no longer recirculate for the rest of that turn.<br>

"Lascinth's Reflexes Effect allows it to remove it's energy from it's<br>

<br>
<br>
Previous effects, if they were "one-shot" and not continuous effects, are<br>
not retroactively removed -- if you Lockdown something that did damage to<br>
your creature earlier, that damage is not 'undone'. However, any ongoing<br>
effects (for example, something that would prevent you from playing Spells<br>
or something that reduces damage taken during combat) are halted. They are,<br>
in a sense, suppressed, and may not come into play or be used by any means<br>
while the Lockdown is in effect.<br>
<br>
If you Lockdown Lockdown, keep in mind you end up quieting all Lockdowns in<br>
the game, including your own. So once you lock it down, you are unable to<br>
access your own Belt as well to do it again until the first one has run its<br>
course.<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
It comes down to the wording on the card. If the Creature says "cannot be<br>
discarded from play..." then the Rock Slide cannot be played at all. If the<br>
Creature says "is not affected by Spells, etc. that specifically discard...<br>
etc." then the Rock Slide can be played but has no effect. In any case it<br>
doesn't revert to the second largest in play.<br>
<br>
4.<br>
<br>

<br>
Yes. Gaining control of a card that did something does not mean that<br>
whatever it did previously is undone.<br>
<br>

<br>

Generally speaking, no. If there are exceptions, it will mention it on the<br>
card.<br>

<br>
Yes. Junjertrug must attack each turn if able, but that does not mean that<br>
as soon as you play him, you must immediately switch to your Attack Step.<br>

<br>
<br>
Although it's often not referred to as such, paying energy to bring out a<br>
creature is not the same thing as just sliding the energy counters from your<br>
Magi to the creature. Rather, the energy is actually and truly lost when<br>
you use it to play a creature, and then when the creature does enter play,<br>
it comes in with whatever its Starting Energy is listed as. So if you want<br>
to bring in a 5-energy creature, you pay 5e off you Magi, and then it comes<br>
in with 5e. If you have a card that allows you a discount on that cost --<br>
say, a Shadow Tony Jones (compliments of Nagsis) -- then, in that example,<br>
you would pay 4e, and then that creature would still come in with energy<br>
equal to it's starting energy -- i.e., 5e. See next question also.<br>

<br>
<br>
You've got it correct. In this case, the Jungle Hyren's ability essentially<br>
let's you 'alter' the Starting energy as listed on the card. So it can<br>
range from 3 to 7, with the cost for it from your Magi as appropriate as<br>
well.<br>
<br>
So if you decide to play it as a 7e creature, you change it's Starting<br>
Energy to 7 as you decide to play it -- it costs you its Starting Energy to<br>
play it (7e), and it also comes in at its Starting Energy (7e).<br>
<br>
Note that Jungle Hyren and similar cards you'll be seeing mention that the<br>
changed Starting Energy only lasts until the end of the turn. This is<br>
because many effects refer to a creature's Starting Energy, and it would be<br>
a logistical nightmare to try and remember what each creature came in at,<br>
especially several turns down the road. However, when the Starting Energy<br>
reverts to the printed number at the end of the turn, it does _not_ change<br>
the amount of energy on the card at that point. Once in play, the amount of<br>
energy a card starts with and the amount it it has at any point in the game<br>
are unconnected.<br>

Sunken Treasure only effects cards when played. The Crown was not played,<br>

<br>
When a creature is played, it triggers all corrupts. They then resolve in<br>
player order, which means that the poor creature is turned Core and goes<br>
into the control of each player in turn as they do so. The end result is<br>
that whoever resolves his Corrupt last (i.e., the last player in player<br>
order) is the one who ultimately ends up with a creature affected by<br>
multiple corrupts.<br>

<br>
Pretty much anything that would reduce energy loss. :-) For example, the<br>
Invulnerability Effect ("X loses one less energy from attacks.") is a good<br>
example with regards to Creatures. Collar doesn't cause an energy loss, it<br>
simply reduces a number on the card (which is then used during the game to<br>
determine how much energy to add to the Magi).<br>

When your current Magi is defeated and you go to get your next one, you<br>
reveal the next _undefeated_ Magi in your stack. It doesn't matter if there<br>
is a Defeated one already in the way.<br>

<br>
When two or more Effects are triggered at the same time, they are resolved<br>
in player order. The active player (the player who's turn it is) resolves<br>
all his effects, then the next player resolves all his, etc., until everyone<br>
has done so.<br>
<br>
So, in this case, Dave plays his 2e Eebit, and Robe and Geyser both trigger.<br>
Dave, as the active player, processes his effects, and adds one energy from<br>
the Robe. Then, when the Eebit Brother gets to resolve his effects, he does<br>
so with the Geyser and the Eebit loses two energy as a result. The Eebit<br>
survives (albeit just barely).<br>

<br>
As Ed mentioned earlier, it's just one Brushfire per turn. The results of<br>
multiple Brushfires in your discard are redundant, not cumulative. They all<br>
say, "once per turn, do X". As a result, the first time each turn you play<br>
a brushfire from your discard pile is the only time that turn you may do so.<br>

Even though you swap Magi, the order of your turn is not changed. If you<br>
are in the 2nd PSR step when you begin Interchange, you are still in the 2nd<br>
PSR step when it is finished.<br>

<br>
RT: If the Deep Hyren is at 7e then once it uses Hurricane it will still be around (at 1e) to be discarded. However, if it is at 6e then it will be immediately discarded when you pay the energy cost for its Power.<br>

Crystal Parmalag from losing energy. <br>
<br>
My question is: Does Burrowed count if used on the<br>
Crystal Parmalag? <br>
<br>
Reason I am ask is that it would seem that someone<br>
could burrow the CP because the spell wouldn't prevent<br>
it from losing all it's energy. This would reduce the<br>
amount it takes. It still losses energy, just two per<br>
turn. :) <br>
<br>
RT: Nice try ;). CP's text is actually specifically to prevent such cards as Burrow from making it too powerful. Burrow doesn't so much as allow two energy loss as much as prevent all other losses over 2e.<br>

RT: Alternative text like that on Gilded Cage simply dictates an action that happens when something else happens (an Activated Effect or pseudo-Effect, to get technical)... and in that sense the GC is not getting "played" persay, you're just following directions.<br>

9. I have an Uwamar Beads in play ("Each turn, the first opposing spell, power or attack that removes energy from your magi discards no energy"). I'm playing in a multiplayer game (Weave, Core, Arderial), and Core plays Blight ("Discard two energy from each non-Core, non-Bograth Creature and Magi in play. Add one energy to each Core and Bograth Creature and Magi in play.").<br>
<br>
By my literal interpretation, the spell does not remove energy from my creatures/magi OR Arderial's creatures/magi, because it would remove energy from my magi (assuming I had energy on my Magi), since the text says "... discards no energy". Is this a correct interpretation?<br>
<br>
The same thing applies if a Deep Hyren uses Hurricane, a Core Grag detonates, etc.<br>
<br>
RT: OFFICIAL CLARIFICATION. Treat Uwamar Beads as if it says "...discards no energy from your Magi." This is how Uwamar Beads is meant to operate (yes that infamous designer intent rears its ugly head again).<br>

11. Similarly, if Agram uses Agram's Plaything to take control of another creature, ("Choose any one of your Creatures in play and any one opposing Creature in play with less energy than your chosen Creature. Discard your chosen Creature. Gain control of the chosen opposing Creature. That Creature may not attack this turn."), the Plaything is in fact discarded, because it was a creature at the time.

12. Finally, I wanted to know if there has been any reversal of, or thoughts of reversing, the ruling about defensive effects triggering an additional time when an attack is redirected (e.g., Bo'Ahsa). It gets sick with Weave. Basically, if Bo'Ahsa has a Pagajack, Speag and a Zassyfer in play, and an opponent attacks the Pagajack, the following happens:<br>
<br>
Pagajack gains 1 from Zassyfer<br>
Speag gains 2<br>
(weaving to/from Pagajack can happen)<br>
Bo'Ahsa redirects attack to Speag<br>
Speag gains 1 from Zassyfer<br>
Speag gains 2 from its own ability (again).<br>
(weaving to/from Speag can happen).<br>

The theory here is that Kesia sets up a global condition (Kesia cannot<br>
play any region but Weave spells.). Mantle sets up a specific exception<br>
to that (Kesia _can_ play a single region (Core) spells.).<br>
<br>
Stealth is less specific: Generally, any Weave magi can play stealth. But<br>
specifically, Kesia cannot.<br>
<br>
It's also intent - stealth is just a core spell some weave magi can cast,<br>
like any other region. Kesia can't do non-Core. But the Mantle is<br>
specifically intented to get around the Non-Core ability.<br>

If you lose control of a Gorath, it does not mean that you lose control of<br>
any creatures that have been enslaved by it. Gorath basically sets up a<br>
condition that says "player 2 controls this Orok, and when this Gorath<br>

<br>
You do not need to pay the energy cost of bringing in the new creature via<br>
Koll; it is already "subsumed" in the process of paying for the Power and<br>
discarding of another creature in the first place. That (and a few other<br>
similarly vague cards) will be clarified in their wording when they are next<br>
printed. Generally speaking, the default assumption for not-specified cards<br>
like this is that if an energy cost is not specified when playing a card in<br>
some alternate fashion, then there is no energy cost.<br>

Correct. It costs you one energy less to play it, but the creatures still<br>
enter play with their starting energy.<br>

<br>
Depends on how the the various cards are worded. Colossus and CP remain in<br>
play, because they are protected against specific creature discards. Deep<br>
Wellisk (which technically doesn't have Anti-Magic, BTW, since it's not a<br>
named Effect) would also remain in play, because it resists being<br>
specifically discarded from play.<br>

"The term "restore" is considered energy addition if the total energy change<br>

if going down. Effects which are triggered upon adding or losing energy<br>
would be activated, as appropriate. If a creature is at the same energy<br>

No, the Core Grag would not be Charmed and the Dark Furok would be (because<br>
as ruled, Charm only works against things that affect a single target, and<br>
not multiples).<br>

<br>
First off, the "opposing cards do not affect Cataclysm when it is played"<br>
refers to cards that can affect it at that instant, not to what _it_ can<br>
affect. For example, you could not Phrup it away as it is being played.<br>
<br>
Shadow Cloak and Orlon: The noted creatures remain in play. In the case of<br>
Cliff Hyren, your relics would be discarded as would your non-Kybar<br>
creatures. All your KT creatures, however, would deflect the blast onto<br>
Cliff Hyren, causing him to be discarded to save the others.<br>

<br>
<br>
If you interchange, then by definition you were not able to "choose a<br>
number" at the beginning of that turn (since Elios wasn't out at the time).<br>
Thus, when the time comes to draw cards, you just draw your normal two<br>
cards. If you play Flood of Energy, you energize at whatever your Magi's<br>
energize rate is at the time. So, yes, if you Interchange into Elios, his<br>
Energize Rate for the remainder of the turn is still 8, since you didn't<br>
adjust it at the beginning of the turn.<br>

<br>
1. It has come to the rules team's attention that there are some conflicts<br>
and misunderstandings with some of the rulings made in the previous rules<br>
digest; those will be corrected and clarified at this time.<br>
<br>
Cataclysm, and more on Barqua's Bubble - This is actually a reversal of the<br>
previous ruling that Cataclysm is not a specific discard. The MagiDuel<br>
website will be updated as soon as possible with the latest ruling; then and<br>
now, as was ruled previously by Steve, Cataclysm specifically discards.<br>
Additionally, Barqua's Bubble still works the way it was ruled, and a<br>
multi-targetting Spell such as Thunderquake cannot be prevented in any way<br>
with the Bubble (as long as the Spell affects multiple Creatures and not<br>
just one).<br>
<br>
Kybar's Echo and Discarding by Attacking - There has been some<br>
misunderstanding on what this means; Kybar's Echo is a replacement effect,<br>
meaning that, whenever one of your Kybar's Teeth Creatures would be<br>
discarded from play, whether it is from an opposing card or by using an<br>
ability of the card, it is instead returned to your hand, but never reaches<br>
the discard pile, and does not technically count as being 'discarded' for<br>
the purposes of triggering other card effects (but it would trigger return<br>
to hand effects such as on Motash's Staff). This clarification is to prevent<br>
the chance of future abuse with cards like Ullig, which could benefit if<br>
there was a Creature that could be discarded immediately after it was<br>
played, potentially creating an infinite energy cycle with her.<br>
<br>
Resonate versus Tranquility (More Paradwyn) - The ruling was made in spite<br>
of the MRP to Tranquility; because of the MRP, Resonate COULD be played in<br>
'discard energy mode', it just would not discard energy. This also means you<br>
may play a Spell such as a Thunderquake while under the effects of a<br>
Tranquility, simply for the reason of discarding energy from your Magi.<br>
<br>

2. The rulebook states specifically,:<br>
"If paying the energy cost for a power leaves a creature with no<br>
energy, it is immediately discarded from play before the power takes<br>
effect."<br>
<br>
I understand that the creature is discarded, but I'm not clear on<br>
whether or not the power still takes effect. It says explicitly that<br>
it is discarded "before" the power takes effect, implying that the<br>
power would take effect immediately after the creature is discarded.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I could see how the rule might be implying that<br>
the effect does not take place because the creature is no longer in<br>
existence. If this is the case, it might have been clearer if the<br>
rule explicitly stated that the power does not take effect. So<br>
essentially, by using the power, you are simply killing the creature<br>
without any effects taking place.<br>
<br>
RT - The Power still happens normally; if the Power affects the now<br>
discarded Creature (such as a Xyx Minor trying to use Gathering Clouds on<br>
itself with only two energy), then the Power will still happen, it just will<br>
not be able to show any result. If that same Xyx Minor spent all of its<br>
energy to use Gathering Clouds on a different Xyx, then the surviving Xyx<br>
would receive the four energy, regardless of the Creature using the Power<br>
being discarded.<br>

3. I am using Blygt in a multiplayer game. Which opposing player gets to<br>
choose the creature discarded when I use Blygt's power?<br>
<br>
RT - 'An opposing player immediately discards one of those Creatures.'<br>
<br>
This means that you choose one of your opponents to choose the Creature to<br>
be discarded.<br>
<br>
Additionally, in order to clear up any confusion on the wording of Waking<br>
Dreams and similar cards, the opponent chooses the Creature to be discarded,<br>
but the Power itself discards the Creature. Therefore, Anti-Magic and<br>
similar discard-prevention abilities cannot be used, unless they prevent you<br>
(the owner/controller) from discarding the Creature.<br>

4. When something refers to "other" creatures. Does that always<br>
mean "other than the creature that this is printed on"? Let me ask<br>
two specific questions to clarify this:<br>
<br>
1) Can a Vogo choose itself?<br>
<br>
2) Can a Spray Narth be put into play if there is only a single<br>
hurricane orish in play.<br>
<br>
RT - When a Creature specifies an 'other Creature' in the description of its<br>
Effect or Power, then it means any other Creature that qualifies for being<br>
affected by the Power or Effect except for the Creature it is printed on.<br>
The Power or Effect can affect other copies of that Creature in play,<br>
however, it just cannot specifically affect itself.<br>
<br>
a - Vogo's Interrupt Effect will not allow you to choose the Vogo if it is<br>
affected by the Spell or Power, nor will it let you redirect the Spell or<br>
Power to it.<br>
<br>
b - Spray Narth's Congregate would reduce the cost of the Narth to 0 if you<br>
had a Hurricane Orish, as it is both another Orothe and another Arderial<br>
Creature. Similarly, if you had one Spray Narth in play, you could play<br>
another at no cost, because, as stated before 'other' can refer to another<br>
copy of the same Creature in play.<br>

Okay first question<br>
<br>
5. IF I am Bograth and I am playing Mist Hyren and I have a deadwood<br>
staff in play am I counting all creatures in play twice. And say my<br>
Magi is Emlob and I have played a Bog Stench to those count twice as<br>
well.<br>
<br>
Also, just to say if I undertood Rayje correct. When I unvail Rayje I<br>
choose 1 of the 5 power or effects for him to have, then the second<br>
time I get that same one and one more. And the third time the two<br>
before and one more. And if someone is using Gremm's Helmet and<br>
chooses Rayje they get all 5. And can Rayje play core cards, can he<br>
play Relics that aren't universal(if not Inhibtor Band just made him<br>
useless). And is Rayje legal for tournament play or was it just a<br>
Preview card.<br>
<br>
RT - If you were to use Deadwood Staff's Calling while playing a Mist Hyren,<br>
it would stack. Also, both Imaginary Friends and Bog Stench would count for<br>
the purposes of either Calling. So, if your Magi was Emlob, and you had<br>
nothing in play except for a Deadwood Staff and were under the effects of a<br>
Bog Stench, you could reduce the cost of Mist Hyren by ten energy (+3<br>
Imaginary Friends, +2 Bog Stench, x2 for both Callings = 10).<br>
<br>
As for Rayje, yes, each time you reveal Rayje, you choose one of his Powers<br>
or Effects. He is then considered to have not only that Power or Effect<br>
printed on him, but also all of the other Powers and Effects that your<br>
previous copies of Rayje had. Therefore, whenever someone uses Gremm's<br>
Helmet to copy him, their Magi will only get the Power(s) and/or Effect(s)<br>
that he has.<br>
<br>
Rayje follows all of the rules for Universal Magi and can only play<br>
Universal Relics as well as non-Core Creatures and Spells. He still pays<br>
regional penalties for any non-Universal Spells or Creatures that he plays.<br>
<br>
Rayje will become legal when Nightmare's Dawn becomes legal for tournament<br>
play, April 19th, 2002.<br>

6. This has been bugging me. If you have Tryn Flamesaver as your magi,<br>
and you use an Ash Hyren to reduce, say a 5 energy Weebo to it's<br>
starting energy, does it become a 8 energy weebo?<br>
<br>
RT - If you use Tryn's first Energy Substitution Power before using the Ash<br>
Hyren to restore the Weebo down to its starting energy, instead of<br>
discarding three energy from the Weebo, it would add three energy, because<br>
three energy would have been the amount to be discarded to return the Weebo<br>
to its starting.<br>

7. The grass etiki gives all Paradwyn creatures weave, and all weave<br>
creatures dream warp. Does this mean that if you had two etiki out,<br>
you Paradwyn creatures would have weave twice and your weave creatures<br>
would have dreamwarp twice? would both effects trigger? For example,<br>
If I brought a Yajo into play, with two Grass Etiki and a Vine Hyren<br>
on the table, could I play the Yajo at a starting energy of three and<br>
give the Vine Hyren two points for it's "Dream Tap" power?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, multiple Grass Etikis would stack; all of your Paradwyn Creatures<br>
could Weave additional energy, and your Weave Creatures could Dreamwarp for<br>
larger amounts (as long as it did not reduce their starting energy below<br>
one).<br>
<br>
Each time the Effect Dreamwarp is activated on one of your other Creatures,<br>
Vine hyren gains one energy; if a Creature had multiple instances of<br>
Dreamwarp, each time you used it, the Hyren would gain one energy.<br>

8. Ok, all this bubble talk has left me incredibly confused, so i'm<br>
going to word this post INCREDIBLY carefully<br>
<br>
Barqua's Bubble<br>
a. In the case of a Multi-targeted spell, like<br>
Cataclysm/Thunderquake/Tidal Wave, can it be used to protect one<br>
creature, all creatures, or no creatures from being discarded<br>
<br>
Ummm....NO!<br>
b. Again, can it save one creature, all creatures, or no creatures<br>
from being discarded by a Multi-Target Spell like Tidal Wave or<br>
Cataclysm?<br>
<br>
Anti-Magic/Deep Wellisk<br>
c. Do they stop Cataclysm?<br>
<br>
M'Lady Iyori<br>
d. Here's a new one. M'Lady Iyori's power says the opposing player<br>
must discard a creature. If my opponent uses M'Lady Iyori, and all i<br>
have in play is a Deep Wellisk, can he make me discard the Deep<br>
Wellisk?<br>
<br>
RT - Answers below, by letter:<br>
<br>
a. If any of those Spells affected more than one Creature, then the Bubble<br>
could any one of them, but not more than one.<br>
<br>
b. Um...NO! says 'when an opponent plays a Spell that would discard one or<br>
more of your Creatures from play' (this is an MRP from www.magiduel.com).<br>
You may use it against a Cataclysm, split Tidal Wave, etc.<br>
<br>
c. No, they do not stop Cataclysm, but they will not be discarded by it,<br>
because Cataclysm tries to specifically discard them.<br>
<br>
d. No; M'lady Iyori's Power is trying to discard the Creature from play, so<br>
any Effect that would prevent an opposing card from specifically discarding<br>
the Creature from play would still apply.<br>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>

More from Anthony:<br>
<br>
9. First, the question is this:<br>
If Zannah and a Baby Furok are in play, and someone tries to kill<br>
that cute little Baby Furok with say a Thunderquake, which effect<br>
triggers first? Charm or Cuddly-Wuddly? Or are the both "spent" for<br>
that turn.<br>
<br>
As I understand, and how it is stated pretty clearly on the magiduel<br>
site is this: the player who is playing Zannah decides which effect<br>
happens first. So that player could choose either one, and then the<br>
other wouldn't occur since energy isn't being removed anymore. Is<br>
this right? I've hear that there is a ruling somewhere that the Baby<br>
Furok happens first.<br>
<br>
Alternate scenario: Baby Furok and a Weebo are out. Someone<br>
Thunderquakes both. The Baby Furok saves itself. Now, the<br>
Thunderquake is going to remove energy from ONLY ONE creature (since<br>
BF is saved), can Zannah's Charm save the Weebo? It seems to me it<br>
shouldn't, but it was something that came up.<br>
<br>
RT - If your Magi is Zannah and the opponent attempts to discard energy only<br>
from Baby Furok during their turn, if that is the first time one of their<br>
cards discards energy, then both Cuddly-Wuddly and Charm are triggered; even<br>
if one or the other doesn't actually prevent any energy loss, it is still<br>
considered used for the turn.<br>
<br>
In your second example, no, Charm would not protect the Weebo. The Baby<br>
Furok does save itself, but since Charm and Cuddly-Wuddly are triggered at<br>
the same time, and Thunderquake is not removing energy from only one<br>
Creature (it's trying to hit the Baby Furok as well), Charm would not<br>
trigger.<br>

<br>
Sorry to bother you guys with this, because it's probably already come<br>
up before. But there were many questions about the new cards in our<br>
tournament today, and we'd like to get some clarification.<br>
<br>
a. Moob Ring vs. Equilibrate. Does Equilibrate count as discarding<br>
energy for the purposes of Moob Ring?<br>
<br>
b. Zunng vs. Weave Hut. Can Zunng move energy from a Weave creature<br>
belonging to a Magi with a Weave Hut in play? If not, does it still<br>
gain one energy and the Weave creature loses none? More to the point,<br>
what is "moving" energy, as opposed to "discarding" or "adding"?<br>
<br>
c. Illusionary creatures. They don't count as being in play when a Magi<br>
is checked for being defeated. Does that mean they're not discarded,<br>
since they're not in play?<br>
<br>
RT - Nightmare's Dawn is not tournament legal until April 19th. Answers<br>
follow.<br>
<br>
a. Equilibrate does discard energy, and would trigger any card effect that<br>
is based on energy discard, including Moob Ring.<br>
<br>
b. The term 'moving' is shorthand for "discard X energy from target A to add<br>
Y energy to target B". The Weave Creature loses nothing, but the Zungg still<br>
receives one energy.<br>
<br>
c. Illusionary Creatures would still be discarded from play, as per the game<br>
rules for Magi defeat. They are only treated as 'not in play' for the<br>
context of determining whether or not the Magi has energy on the table.<br>

RT - Enslavement has no cost associated with it; when you use it, you choose<br>
an energy total and discard that much from Gorath, then gain control of a<br>
Creature with energy less than what you just discarded. Power Drain would<br>
move nothing from Gorath. Furthermore, any X is treaded as zero except in<br>

my personal interpretation is "no".<br>
<br>
RT - Actually, yes, only Naroom and Naroom shadow Magi could play the Tomes,<br>
even if they were Cleansed. This is because the reminder text also<br>
technically grants Naroom or Naroom Shadow Magi the ability to play the<br>
card, just as Crushing Roots says 'only Naroom Magi and Naroom Shadow Magi<br>
may play Crushing Roots', which grants Naroom Shadow Magi the ability to<br>
play it.<br>
<br>
Similarly, if a Core/Bograth card were Cleansed to Underneath, only Core and<br>
Bograth Magi still could play it; not even an Underneath Magi could play the<br>
Cleansed card, because of the specific restriction.<br>

15. If my opponent has played a Corrupt first turn, and on my turn I have<br>
no creatures, can I play a Quido Swarm for 0 energy to get rid of the<br>
Corrupt? My interpretation: A creature is being play so the Corrupt<br>
gets discarded to try and take that creature. The creature has no<br>
energy, so it gets taken but gets discarded. In contrast to I play<br>
Green Stuff for 0 energy, the corrupt is discarded, the Green Stuff<br>
gains one, and the opponent gets it. If I can play Green Stuff for 0<br>
I should be able to do the same with Quido Swarm.<br>
<br>
RT - Quido Swarm may be played with no Creatures on the table; it will<br>
immediately discard itself for having no energy. This would trigger a<br>
Corrupt, forcing it to be discarded from play, and the Quido Swarm would<br>
become your opponent's Core Creature for the split second it was in play.<br>
Any other come into play Effects (Strengthen, Dream Barrier) could still be<br>
used as well.<br>

I realize they are not dual region. so that brings up another<br>
question... can Naroom Shadow play Crushing Roots without entombing<br>

<br>
RT - Cleansing the Crushing cards would not change what Magi could play<br>
them, with one exception; Crushing Darkness, if Cleansed, could then be<br>
played by any non-Shadow Magi.<br>

1. In the previous Rules Digest, there were a pair of contradictory rulings regarding Barqua's Bubble and multi-targetting cards. The final decision of the rules team is that Barqua's Bubble can protect a single Creature from a Spell or Power with multiple targets. This is a reversal of the previous ruling regarding Barqua's Bubble, and now, for instance, if a Thunderquake were split to discard 4, 3, and 3 amongst three Creatures, the energy discard to one of those Creatures could be prevented with the Bubble. <br>
<br>
In regards to the ruling about Tomes of the Great Library and Cleansing, this was a card that the reminder text was not placed on. If it were Cleansed, only Magi that could play Underneath or Kybar's Teeth Relics could play it (depending on what it was Cleansed to), but it would be discarded immediately if the Magi was not Naroom or Naroom Shadow. <br>

<br>
Situation: Bograth goes first, drops a ton of creatures, and plays Mydra Swarm on his opponent (Choose a player. If you have at least 4 Paradwyn or Bograth creatures in play, the chosen player cannot draw any cards on his/her next turn). <br>
Does the other player get (A) just his starting cards, or (B) starting + enough to get to 5? <br>
<br>
RT - The cards that a player draws to get a hand of five at the beginning of their first turn of the game do not count as drawing cards for the purposes of in game effects. For instance, if a player started with Marella as their first Magi, they would still receive any one Weave Creature then draw four cards, as well as drawing one card at the end of her turn. Similarly, if there were some way to give a player who has not started their turn a Creature, and you had a Darkbreed's Minion in play, their Creature would not lose energy from Smolder. In your example, the Mydra Swarm would only stop them from drawing cards with card effects and the two cards at the end of their first turn.<br>

3. Previously it had been ruled that a spell could not be played for zero, be <br>
it just to get it out of your hand or to trigger effects that are based on <br>
that spell's effect. In this rules digest it was ruled that you *could* <br>
play quido swarm for zero to get rid of corrupt. How is this different than <br>
playing a spell for zero to discard zero energy from a creature that is <br>
protected from the first spell that discards energy? Though you are <br>
discarding "zero" energy, you are *actively* discarding zero energy, which <br>
is different than just looking at the creature and saying "Wow, he is losing <br>
zero energy!" If you can blow a creature to get rid of a spell in play <br>
(such as Corrupt) shouldn't you be able to blow a spell for a similar <br>
reason? <br>
<br>
But then again, perhaps you can and the ruling to which I refer was just <br>
someone answering a rules question and not telling us that it was <br>
unofficial. <br>
Please clarify this, please. And if you can do it with the creature but not <br>
the spell, could you please explain why? Thank you. <br>
<br>
RT - It is perfectly legal to play a card with an X cost if X equals 0, whether by choice or happenstance (such as using Sorreah's Dream on a no cost Power). <br>
<br>
As for playing a Spell to discard zero energy to get around an Effect (such as Charm), any Effect like that has to actively prevent energy from being discarded. Discarding zero energy is discarding no energy, just as any other moment in time when a card is not under 'attack' from another source it could theoretically be said that it is having zero energy discarded from it. Similarly, a card such as Scroll of Fire cannot be triggered if there is no energy discard to add to. These cards are triggered under the condition that an energy amount is to be discarded from another card. Zero, by definition, means "lacking an amount". <br>
<br>
Finally, there are times when it is strategically sound to play a Creature that will be discarded anyway, such as using a J'Lith to discard a Corrupt when you have no Relics in play so that the J'Lith can discard itself before the opponent gets it. The rules team is aware of the potential for abuse with being able to play Creatures that would discard themselves immediately, especially with little to no cost (such as Quido Swarm), and a Magi such as Ullig. If not for the clarification on Kybar's Echo, it was entirely possible to create a deck that started with Bria, played Abwyn's Quill, Interchanged to Ullig, played Kybar's Echo Overwriting Kybar's Teeth to Bograth, then generated infinite energy by cycling a zero energy Quido Swarm. She can still get a nine energy boost if you hold three Swarms for her, but we are keeping an eye on situations such as this, and will make every effort to repair anything like that gets out of hand. <br>

4. 2 Ritual Spear <br>

Power – Change of Heart: Discard Ritual Spear from play. Choose any one of <br>
your defeated Kybar’s Teeth or Weave Magi. Defeat your current Magi. The <br>
chosen Magi is returned to play with your Magi’s current energy and does not<br>

Creatures in play. You can only recover any Magi once. <br>

The last sentence can be taken 2 ways. Does it mean that each Magi can be<br>
returned to play one time each? Say, if you had 3 Ritual Spears in your <br>
deck. Or does it mean that only one of your Magi may be returned to play <br>
once? The first interpretation is incredibly powerful especially with <br>
Wessig in the deck, so I was wondering what the card’s intent is. <br>
<br>

this and reducing damage. Which of us is correct? <br>
<br>
c) What happens if I use Tomes of the Great Library <br>
to play a spell that would normally remain in play, or <br>
would normally attach to a creature or magi? I ssume <br>
it would immediately be placed in my discard pile or <br>
shuffled into my opponents library because of the text <br>
on tomes. <br>
Power Research: 1 Search your deck or any opposing <br>
discard pile for any one Spell. Play the chosen spell <br>
ignoring regional restrictions. If that spell came <br>
from your deck discard it. If it came from an opposing <br>
discard pile shuffle it into its owners deck. <br>
I have considered the possiblity that the intention <br>
was only to set a condition on what would happen when <br>
the spell would normally leave play. <br>
<br>
RT - Answers below: <br>
<br>
a - If a card discards energy, and there are other effects in play that stop any from of energy discard prevention, then the energy discard will happen, even if the victim of the energy discard could normally not be affected by anything; however, other effects of the card will still be prevented. <br>
<br>
For instance, if you have a Koil that has been protected by Shadow Cloak, and your opponent had a Rayje's Sword in play and used Firefly Swarm on the Koil, the Koil would lose two energy, but it would be protected from the secondary effect of Firefly Swarm, and could still attack on your next turn. <br>
<br>
b - Resilience prevents any excess energy discard that would result in Olabra's Creatures being reduced to less than one energy. If the energy removal could not be prevented, Resilience would do nothing. <br>
<br>
c - Treat Research as if it said, "When that Spell leaves play, if that Spell came from your deck, discard it. If it came from an opposing discard pile, shuffle it into its owners deck." This was the intent of Research. <br>

<br>
RT - Pyromancy only increases the amount of energy discarded; Syphon Vortex's "move" is shorthand for 'discard X energy from an opposing Creature and add X energy to your Magi'. Pyromancy does not increase X, it changes the amount of energy discarded to X+1. <br>
<br>
As for the added energy discard by the Effect, it increases the energy discarded by the Spell, and Burrow would still prevent the excess over two. <br>

Then if I discard the Chasm Jile to play a Grass Hyren free from <br>

<br>
RT - In the first situation, when the Yajo is attacked, its Weave is triggered, and it may transfer one energy to or from another Weave Creature in play. When it is swapped with the Jile, the Jile does not have Weave, and therefore no energy can be transferred; however, if the new defender had Weave, Weave would be triggered just the same, on the new defender. Also note that other Effects triggered by your Creatures being attacked (such as with Speag) would trigger both times. <br>
<br>
When you discard the Jile and play the Hyren, the Hyren replaces the Jile in the attack; any new Effects that are a result of the Creature being attacked are triggered, so this would yet again trigger both Weave and any similar Effects (such as Speag). <br>

9. First about the new promo cards. <br>
<br>
Nightmare's Dawn -2- <br>
All Magi that only have cards of their region in play gain 5 energy. <br>
<br>
<br>
If they have any Universal Cards in play would that count as out of <br>
region. I would think yes, but the question arose. <br>
<br>
The next question is if your Magi is Eidon, and you have staff of <br>
keepers in play, you choose Weave. when you play Baby Furok which is <br>
a Naroom/Weave creature does it gain the one energy from SOK. <br>
<br>
Inhibtor's Band vs. Tomorrows Jewels. <br>
<br>
Does tomorrow's Jewels stay in play. I would think no, because it's <br>
not getting discarded it's going to your hand. <br>
<br>
RT - With Nightmare's Dawn, Universal cards, unless the Magi were Universal, would be out of region for them, and they would not gain the energy. <br>
<br>
As Baby Furok fits the qualification of being a Weave Creature, and Eidon is a Keeper, the Furok would gain one energy. <br>
<br>
Finally, returning a card to hand is very different from discarding it from play; the Jewel would bounce to the opponent's hand. If the Jewel were discarded from your hand while there was an Inhibitor Band in play, you could not play the Jewel, and it would be discarded <br>

RT - Though awkwardly worded, Withdraw is a replacement effect, similar to the one discussed in the previous rules digest with Kybar's Echo. As such, when Undertow discards the Hyren, it returns to its owner's hand. When a card leaves a public area, all unresolved, in play effects of cards targetting it do nothing. Since the Hyren is now in hand and no longer around to be shuffled into your deck, the second part of Undertow fizzles. <br>

power, even though the K'teeb Thumper was not in play when it happened? <br>
<br>
RT - Answers below: <br>
<br>
a - Yes; the Forest Jile, or Corf, does not need to be in play for your other Creatures (or opposing Creatures) to remember that they were involved in combat that turn. As long as they are the same Creature that attacked or was attacked, and have not left the playing field and then returned somehow, they "know" what happened. <br>
<br>
b - Yes; in fact, this is strategically sound, as a "surprise". Similarly, you may play a Pody and Backhand a Creature that attacked you on the opponent's last turn. <br>

RT - Dreamwarp lets you temporarily raise or lower the starting energy of a Creature by a set amount, stated in the description of the Dreamwarp Effect, as the Creature is being played. The new, altered starting energy cannot be either less than one, or greater than the amount of energy the Magi trying to play the Creature has. Finally, all changes made to a Creature's starting energy total by Dreamwarp go away at the end of the turn in which the Creature was played. Essentially, all Dreamwarp does it let you play the Creature either a little smaller then usual or a little larger than usual, depending on what you want to spend. <br>

<br>
Aka - I have 13 Cald creatures in play, and i play a Flame Trulb. <br>

because the Trulb itself is the only Bograth creature in play? <br>
<br>
RT - Flame Trulb does count itself; its Effect does not trigger until the Trulb is actually in play, and Familiarity does not say "other" Bograth and Cald Creatures in play. <br>
<br>
Because of this, the Flame Trulb will always gain at least one energy, under normal circumstances, since there will be at least one Bograth and one Cald Creature in play. If there was an instance where it was not one of the two regions (such as Ruid mutating it to Cald/Core), and you had no other Bograth Creatures in play, the Trulb would gain zero energy, as zero is the lesser amount. <br>

Feast. Reduce your magi's energize by two. Does this stack? because <br>
if it does, then it would be like having 2 or 3 nightmare channels <br>
on my magi if I had 2 or 3 Grand Epik out. That would suck because <br>
my magi would probably be energizing for nothing. And the Dream <br>
Binge effect would not work then because my Arderial magi would no <br>
longer be energizing. So my Grand Epiks would sit out there doing <br>
nothing. <br>
The second creature is the Kybars/Underneath Creature Akkar. It's <br>
effect Rolling Thunder increases my magi's energize rate by two when <br>
my opponent has more creatures out then me. Does this stack? If so, <br>
it would be like having three Dream Channels on my magi if I had <br>
three Akkar out and my opponent was playing a swarm deck. I hope <br>
this does stack because Kybars and Underneath have good defense but <br>
often a swarm deck will steadily chip away at them while building up <br>
an army. <br>
<br>
RT - Depends on how the Energize modifiers are worded. In the case of Grand Epik and Akkar, described specifically as subtractions or additions to the actual energize rate, the effects would stack, decreasing or increasing your Magi's energize rate from two to six or possibly even more.. <br>
<br>
In the case where you have two or more cards that are worded to grant "ENERGIZE:1", then the end result would be the Creature having only ENERGIZE:1 (the exception being that if the card already had a higher energize rate, it would use that; cards always use their highest energize rate). <br>

Ritual spear reads:<br>
<br>
Discard Ritual Spear from play. Chose any one of your defeated KT or<br>
Weave Magi. Defeat your current Magi.....<br>
<br>
What happens if that's my last magi?<br>
<br>
I now have 3 defeated magi. Don't I lose the game at that point? I<br>
can't have two magi in play, so I can't say the new magi is back yet.<br>
And under the order it's written, my magi is defeated, then another magi<br>
comes in.<br>
<br>
I see that maybe the creatures keep you alive, except that it's been<br>
ruled that Ritual Spear does defeat the magi (CF Wessig). So how does<br>
that work out?<br>
<br>
RT - All parts of a Spell, Power, or Effect resolve before you check to see<br>
if Magi are defeated. Change of Heart will have an opportunity to resolve<br>
fully before the game is declared a loss for the player using Ritual Spear.<br>

2. If I have a Hurricane Orish in play with Voice of the Storm, and I<br>
play a another Hurricane Orish. Does it come in for two less energy?<br>
<br>
RT - The Hurricane Orish in play, being both Orothe and Arderial, will<br>
decrease the cost of your Arderial and your Orothe Creatures played. When<br>
you play another Hurricane Orish, because it is an Orothe Creature, it will<br>
cost one less, and because it is an Arderial Creature, it will cost an<br>
additional one less, therefore, the end result is that it costs two less<br>
energy to play.<br>

5. If I have a Grim Goblet in play and I use Rayje's Belt lockdown<br>
to cancel the backlash effect to prevent my hand from discarting and<br>
a Beam of Light is use to discard both relics at the same time.<br>
<br>
Do I have to discard my hand, because the lockdown power lose<br>
it's effect or not?<br>
<br>
And what about if I have an Abranix Crown in my hand, will it<br>
take effect or not?<br>
<br>
RT - Lockdown will end when the Belt leaves play; similarly, any continuous<br>
effects of a Power do not end until the card(s) targetted by Beam of Light<br>
are successfully discarded from play. The Grim Goblet has also already been<br>
discarded, and you will not suffer the Backlash.<br>
<br>
If you do suffer from Backlash and are forced to discard an Abraxin's Crown,<br>
its discard effect will not trigger; it must be discarded from your hand by<br>
an opposing card to do so, even if an opposing card forced you to discard<br>
the Goblet and triggered Backlash.<br>

6. I assume because of the text for sneak attack that<br>
cards which set the amount of damage a creature does<br>
during an attack by some mechanism such as making it<br>
do only its starting energy is not the same from a<br>
rules mechanic view as reducing the amount of energy<br>
lost, even if this adjustment reduces the amount of<br>
damage a creature does? If I have a Rayjes sword and<br>
a 15 energy wudge and attack and elder Yark how much<br>
damage does my wudge do?<br>
<br>
RT - Any card that would cause a Creature to remove it's starting energy<br>
instead of it's current in an attack is not considered to be preventing<br>
energy loss; therefore, Rayje's Sword does not go into effect. Your 15<br>
energy Wudge would only remove one energy if an Elder Yark were present.<br>

9. I have a couple of questions that came to mind yesterday.<br>
<br>
a. What happens when you have more than one Pyder in play?<br>
<br>
b. Can Swamp Weebo choose less than X Creatures? Could you choose the same<br>
Creature more than once in order to avoid killing your own Creatures? Some<br>
cards specify that you can or cannot choose the same Creature more than<br>
once. Swamp Weebo does not say either way.<br>
<br>
RT - Answers follow:<br>
<br>
a - Each time you play a new Pyder, you transfer all but one energy your<br>
Magi currently has to it.<br>
<br>
Whenever you play a Creature, each Pyder's Summoning will trigger. As the<br>
active player, you choose the order they resolve in. You must choose a Pyder<br>
that has enough energy to play the Creature to resolve first, or you cannot<br>
play the Creature. The rest of your Pyder's Summonings will resolve, and you<br>
will discard energy from them equal to how much energy is necessary to pay<br>
the cost of the Creature played, which is now zero.<br>
<br>
When your Magi energizes, all of your Pyders Leaderships will trigger. You<br>
choose which resolves first, and that Pyder receives all of the extra energy<br>
beyond one of the Magi. The rest of your Pyder's will receive zero energy,<br>
since your Magi does not have any amount over one any longer.<br>
<br>
b. Swamp Weebo must discard X energy from X different Creatures.<br>

Corrupt<br>
Choose any one Magi in play. Attach Corrupt to the chosen Magi. If<br>

When a Creature is played by any Magi, discard Corrupt from play. The<br>

region, and your Magi gains control of that Creature.<br>
<br>
Ok we've figured out that the best play for the bograth player here<br>
is to just choose 1 creature and let it kill the corrupt. What we<br>
really want to know is what happens if Blygt wakes up 3 creatures.<br>
Does the Core player choose one to discard, one to steal and one to<br>

costs, but ignoring regional penalties and restrictions. Shuffle that<br>
player's deck and discard the chosen Spell afterward.<br>
<br>
<br>
Do I pay for spells that I research?<br>
<br>
RT - The player using Waking Dreams will choose the Creature that Corrupt<br>
affects . The other two Creatures will enter play, and an opponent of<br>
Blygt's player's choice will choose one of the three Creatures to be<br>
discarded (probably not the one that was Corrupted).<br>
<br>
As for Research, you do pay all costs for the Spell; otherwise, there would<br>
be a note that says something along the lines of "if a Spell has a cost of<br>
X, X is equal to zero".<br>

11. The way i understand it right now BoL works like this. I can use it to<br>
discard a creature or relic with 2 or less energy on it even if that<br>
relic or creature cannot be discarded due to an effect or power that<br>
is on the card itself. This is due to the fact of a precedence ruling<br>
that was established when BoL came out that its cancellation of<br>
ongoing effect and the discarding of the creature-relics takes place<br>
simultaneously.<br>
<br>
RT - No; the text on cards happen in the order that the text is written,<br>
unless the card itself states an exception. Beam of Light cannot discard<br>
anything that cannot be specifically discarded from play, and if a card<br>

Anthony (the_black_avocado@...) asks:<br>
<br>
1. Kinda curious. When Sheath says it prevents a creature from using an<br>
effect, does it shut off effects like "Burrow"? Or does this simply<br>
mean one time use effects.<br>
<br>
RT - Depends. Sheath will not allow the Effects of the Creature it is<br>
printed on to be used. If a Creature such as Pylofuf is Sheathed, then it<br>
loses the ability to use Burrow, and its burrow status is removed since it<br>
is granted by an Effect on the Creature. If you have a Korrit that has had a<br>
nine turn Burrow Spell cast on it, then Sheathing it does not remove its<br>
burrowed status, because none of the Effects on the Creature are what grants<br>
Burrow. Similarly, if a Tunnel Hyren is Sheated, its Burrow is stopped, but<br>
if you have an Underneath Creature that becomes Sheathed while you have a<br>
Tunnel Hyren in play, the Creature will still have the benefit of being<br>
burrowed, as long as the Hyren is in play and can use its Effect.<br>

2. Rayje has the following text:<br>

You can play with more than one copy of Rayje in your deck. When you reveal<br>
Rayje, he gains all Powers and Effects on all your defeated Rayjes and any<br>
one of the following Powers or Effects until the end of the game:<br>
<br>
And then he has a list of Powers and Effects to choose from. Because he<br>
doesn't say he's restricted, can I choose the same Power or Effect more than<br>
once? Also, because of the way he's worded, doesn't he end up with four<br>
Powers and/or Effects in his third form? He gets one copy of all Powers and<br>
Effects on your first Rayje, and then one copy of all of your Powers and<br>
Effects on your second Rayje (which would be the first plus the second one<br>
chosen), and then also the newest one you select for him? This probably<br>
isn't how he was intended, but this is how me and everyone at my store have<br>
read him.<br>
<br>
RT - Rayje was not intended to function in that manner; he is only able to<br>
choose a specific Power or Effect once. Additionally, he could be<br>
interpreted as literally gaining four copies of the Powers and Effects, but<br>
another, fairer (and more correct) interpretation of the intended meaning<br>
was that he gets one copy of each Power and Effect by name only.<br>
<br>
However, for the sake of absolute clarity, treat Rayje as if he has the<br>
following line of text after his listing of Powers and Effects: "Each time<br>
Rayje is revealed, he may not gain more than one copy of any Power or<br>
Effect." This should prevent any further confusion.<br>

4. Here are the 5 things in dispute from this weekends games(all non-<br>
tournament, but they need to be ironed out before the Story-line).<br>
For each, I'll break the scenario down so you can just choose which<br>
ruling is correct:<br>
-----------------------<br>
Pylofuf vs Giant Korrit<br>
<br>
If I have a Pylofuf in play with 7 energy, and it is attack by an<br>
opposing Shielded Parmalag with 2 energy on it with a 4 energy Giant<br>
Korrit joining in the attack, what amount of energy is removed from<br>
the Pylofuf? Does the Pack Hunt Effect remove extra damage from the<br>
Pylofuf, or does the Effect Enable an Attack which does not allow for<br>
more than 2 energy to be removed this turn?<br>
--------<br>
Emlob, Trulb Horde & 1 energy<br>
<br>
My opponent has Emlob as his Magi with one energy and no creatures<br>
in play. He casts a Trulb Horde bringing his Magi to 0 energy, but<br>
as the Spell resolves, a 1 Energy creature is coming in to play. Is<br>
Emlob defeated before the Creature comes into play since he has no<br>
energy and no creatures, or is the Magi not checked for defeat until<br>
after any given spell resolves?<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Bograth or Core Magi, Crushing Stench or Crushing Darkness & 4 energy<br>
<br>
Either a Bograth Magi casts Crushing Stench or a Core Magi casts<br>
Crushing Darkness to discard a creature and bring something into<br>
play. Like the previous question, does the Magi get defeated as the<br>
Spell resolves, or stay in play because a creature is coming into<br>
play after resolution. Like Before if the answer is no, would Emlob<br>
be able to because while the Spell is resolving he is considered to<br>
have 3 extra Bograth creatures.<br>
---------------<br>
Colossus & Turn<br>
<br>
I have a Colossus in play with 2 energy. My opponent casts Turn on<br>
it. He obviously gets the Colossus, but does the Colossus get<br>
restored to it's Starting Energy?<br>
-----<br>
Morag<br>
<br>
Morag spends 3 energy to take a Robe of the Ages for 2 turns.<br>
Exactly how long does Theft take a relic for?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Answers below:<br>
<br>
Pylofuf vs. Giant Korrit: The Pylofuf loses two energy from the attack, if<br>
it has not previously lost energy that turn from other Spells, Powers, or<br>
attacks. Pack Hunt, though an Effect, grants the Korrit an ability to attack<br>
with another Creature and not lose any energy in the attack. It is still an<br>
attack for the Korrit in all regards, except that it loses no energy.<br>
<br>
Emlob, Trulb Horde & 1 energy: All pending card effects that have not been<br>
resolved are resolved before a Magi checks for defeat. The Creature will be<br>
put into play before Emlob is defeated for having no energy.<br>
<br>
Imaginary Friends would not let him survive, either; if that were the case,<br>
he could never be defeated unless that Effect were somehow rendered<br>
inoperable while he had no energy in play.<br>
<br>
Bograth or Core Magi, Crushing Stench or Crushing Darkness & 4 energy: All<br>
effects of the Spell will resolve before a Magi is checked for defeat. A<br>
good rule of thumb is, if by the time the Spell reaches the discard pile the<br>
casting Magi has no energy in play, then they are defeated; until then, the<br>
Magi cannot be defeated while the Spell card is in the middle of being used.<br>
<br>
With both of these Crushing cards, they will put their Creature into play<br>
before the Magi could ever have a chance to be defeated.<br>
<br>
Colossus & Turn: Turn attempts to restore the Creature to its starting<br>
energy after the controllers are changed. Since the controlling player<br>
cannot add energy to Colossus, it is not restored.<br>
<br>
Morag: Theft gives Morag control of a Relic for his next X turns; if he<br>
spent three, he would have the Relic this turn and his next three .<br>

my creatures, can I play Beam of Light to cancel the effect of the<br>
Crushing Heat?<br>
<br>
C. Can I use Beam of Light to cancel Cleansing?<br>
<br>
RT - Answers below:<br>
<br>
A: Crushing Heat will stop your Magi from being able to use the Effect on<br>
Rayje's Cloak that protects you from Lockdown style effects. Because of<br>
this, your Magi would then be unable to use Powers or Effects on them or<br>
their other Relics in play.<br>
<br>
B: Beam of Light can only be used to discard a Spell card that stays in<br>
play; it can do nothing to stop ongoing effects of Spells that leave play.<br>
<br>
C: See the above ruling; just as Beam of Light cannot remove the effects of<br>
Entomb, neither can it do so to Cleansing.<br>

6. I have some official rulings on some cards I think may come into play<br>
next<br>
weekend at our storyline tourney. I hope someone can help clear them up<br>
before then so we don't have any disputes. Would greatly appreciate the help<br>
:-)<br>
<br>
Kalius - If you use Abwyn's Quill on Wind Spawn to change it to Core, you<br>
should be able to "play any one Core creature from your hand" right?<br>
<br>
Focus - It says you can't play cards until the end of your next turn. Does<br>
this just mean cards from your hand? What about cards in play? Can O'Qua<br>
still Conjure? Could an Ergar spark? Or a Dream Balm in play Vitalize a<br>
creature after it attacks?<br>
<br>
Bria - Can Bria choose Core with Obsession, and take two Core starting<br>
relics? It says ANY one region...no?<br>
<br>
RT - Answers below:<br>
<br>
Kalius: Overwriting Wind Spawn does not simply allow Kalius to play Core<br>
Creatures; it would have to say "play a Core Creature ignoring regional<br>
restrictions" if that were the case. Overwriting Wind Spawn to Core means<br>
that Kalius can only play a Core Creature that Arderial Magi could play,<br>
such as Dark Ayebaw, Shryque, Harban, etc.<br>
<br>
Focus: You cannot play cards; this includes using Powers on your cards that<br>
put other cards into play. If you attempted to Conjure, you would search<br>
your deck, then shuffle it, without putting anything into play.<br>
<br>
Using an ability on a card is wholly unrelated to playing the card; if the<br>
card is in play to use a Power or Effect, then it has already went through<br>
the procedure of being played and Focus does not stop you from using it in<br>
any way.<br>
<br>
Bria: She may choose Core, and then be able to play Core Relics. Also, she<br>
is not restricted to taking Relics of the region she names; she may name<br>
Core and take two Orothe Relics, etc., as long as the Relics are<br>
non-Universal.<br>

7. With Bria and fetching her starting cards, do I specify a region first<br>
and<br>
then get the relics of the region I specified, or do I have to look in the<br>
discard pile first and if I have a non-universal relic in there, I MUST<br>
fetch relics of that specific region? Thanks.<br>
<br>
RT - As with any other 'any' starting card specification, you must search<br>
the discard pile first for any cards that fit the 'any' specification.<br>
<br>
For example, if you would like to fetch her two Secrets of the Book but had<br>
a Hubdra's Spear in your discard pile, she would have to take it and another<br>
Orothe Relic, either from the discard pile or, if another is not there, from<br>
your deck. If there is no second Orothe Relic, then you cannot retrieve that<br>
starting card.<br>

8. If Tryn uses SV on one of her creature, that creature gains X energy<br>
instead of losing X enegery while it only cost her 4 right? Now let<br>
say that Tryn has this insane amount of energy on her, does that mean<br>
that she could choose X to be this huge number to add to her creature<br>
while it only cost her 4?<br>
<br>
RT - This would have been the case, if she had not received her Effect in<br>
playtesting. The Effect does not allow her cards to add energy to her,<br>
including Syphon Vortex. If she used Syphon Vortex, she would spend X + 4,<br>
and regain nothing; her Energy Substitution would convert the energy discard<br>
to energy gain, however.<br>
<br>
Her potential ability to, for instance, channel everything into a<br>
Substituted Syphon Vortex and then Updraft the Creature for an incredible<br>
energy advantage was just one of the more abusive reasons why this change<br>
was made.<br>

9. Can I use Warrada in a deck with The Dark Twins, since the DT only count<br>
as an Alternate Hrada?<br>
<br>
* If I CAN'T, that means that the Twins also count as an Alternate Warrada<br>
even if it's not printed on the card? So I could grab all Warrada's Starting<br>
Cards with my Dark Twins?<br>
<br>
* If I CAN - and Double-Magi that don't specifically say that they're<br>
alternate copies are not considered Alternate Magi for those Magi that are<br>
not in the card text - that means I can use single Korg or Zet with<br>
KORG&ZET(6/11)? So Zet's Good Riddance (If Korg is in any player's defeated<br>
Magi pile, add 3 energy to Zet's starting energy) would trigger if my first<br>
Magi was Korg&Zet?<br>
<br>
RT - The Dark Twins are only an alternate Hrada; as shown in the fictions,<br>
they fight together, but Warrada plays a more supportive role, letting her<br>
brother take the force of the fight, so that even if he falls with her help,<br>
she can step in at full power and sweep up their weakened foes. Because the<br>
Twins are only an alternate Hrada, and Warrada is not mentioned in the name<br>
of the card, she can be played with them.<br>
<br>
Korg or Zet cannot be played with Korg & Zet; it has been ruled that you<br>
cannot have more than one Magi with the same name in a deck. Korg & Zet are,<br>
technically speaking, an Alternate Korg/Alternate Zet because of this<br>
ruling, and because of that cannot be played with Korg or Zet. Additionally,<br>
All-High King Korg is technically an Alternate Korg.<br>
<br>
If Korg or All-High King Korg are in any defeated Magi pile, either of them<br>
trigger Good Riddance.<br>

10. While the intent is pretty clear here, the wording of this ruling<br>
does create certain inconsitencies with Gia's Unearth Power, and<br>
Tommorow's Jewel. These both allow you to play something without<br>
paying the cost. While "Unearth" says directly into play, Tommorow's<br>
Jewel says simply "play". It has long been the ruling that when TJ<br>
was being discarded from your hand you didn't have to pay 1. Sooo...<br>
I'd hate to say it, but an MRP of Tome's may be in order, or else<br>
some clarification to know when you pay a cost and when you don't.<br>
Personally, I think because the "Hand" and "Heart" say 'paying all<br>
costs', that Tomes should just say the same.<br>
<br>
RT - From now on, cards will explicitly be templated to state whether or not<br>
you pay the costs for them if they have an alternate means of entering play;<br>
the Tomes were simply a case of human error, because they did not go through<br>
as many changes in playtesting as some other cards, so the wording missed<br>
revision from the older template. Consider the ruling on the Tomes and their<br>
cost a clarification for the moment, just as Tomorrow's Jewel was, and the<br>
wording will have a strict revision the next time it sees print.<br>

11. Questions A:<br>
If I have a magi with no energy and I have a Quido Swarm in play.<br>
When my turn begins the Quido Swarm will die since is the only<br>
creatures. So my magi will be defeated or not?<br>
<br>
<br>
Question B:<br>
Eryss<br>
Effect Discordia: Once per turn, when and opposing Magi plays a non-<br>
Universal Creature not of their Magi's region, you may choose and<br>
discard one of that Magi's Creatures from play.<br>
<br>
Ok. Since Ormagon can discard Kybar/Underneath creatures and Wessig's<br>
Landslide can't discard a Kybar/Underneath creature either I guess<br>
that Eryss can't discard a creatures if (Ex.) Gar play a Flame<br>
Rudwot, right? Flame Rudwot is and is not from the Magi's Region.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question C:<br>
<br>
Can Ayebaw gains 2 energy from the Storm Ring for attack twice? Or if<br>
Yaki attack with Lava Balamants, will they gain 2 energy or not?<br>
<br>
RT - Answers below:<br>
<br>
A: Quido Swarm restores itself to a starting energy of zero and is discarded<br>
from play at the beginning of the turn, before the energize step can begin;<br>
the Magi is defeated, but your next Magi is not revealed until your next<br>
turn.<br>
<br>
B: An Ormagon will not discard a multi-region Underneath Creature.<br>
Additionally, for a Creature to qualify as being not of their Magi's region,<br>
then none of its regions can match the Magi. If at least one of the regions<br>
matches, the Creature is the same region as their Magi.<br>
<br>
C: Each time a Creature begins a new attack, under normal circumstances, all<br>
Effects triggered by it attacking happen again. The Storm Ring would add one<br>
energy each time the Ayebaw attacked, as Charge will add one energy to the<br>
Balamant each time it attacks.<br>

Question A:<br>
I am playing Paradwyn, and I have 3 energy on my magi. I assume that I can<br>
play a 4E creature with Dreamwarp (warping down to 3), because I am warping<br>
the creature AS I play it.<br>
<br>
Now, I have a Jungle Hyren (or one of the other cards that lets me warp an<br>
opponent's creatures). Can my Opponent attempt to summon a creature that he<br>
doesn't have the energy for, in hopes that I will warp the starting energy<br>
down to where he can afford it? While this may not seem like it would happen<br>
in a duel, it CAN (and has) come up in a multiplayer game (and could also be<br>
a big question in team play).<br>
<br>
Question B:<br>
I target a Treepsh with a Crushing X spell. The Treepsh pops itself to<br>
cancel its own energy loss. I assume that the secondary effects of the<br>
Crushing X spell do not happen?<br>
<br>
Question C:<br>
I am playing Paradwyn, and have Bazha's Pendant in play (lets me use powers<br>
in response to an opponent playing powers, spells or relics). My opponent<br>
casts a Crushing X spell on my Lahalou, which is at 4E. Can I use the<br>
Lahalou's power to grow by one before the resolution of the spell so that it<br>
will survive?<br>
<br>
RT - Answers below:<br>
<br>
A: You cannot attempt to play a card in the hopes that something in play<br>
will allow you to play it. Just as an Arderial Magi could not play Crushing<br>
Heat and then Overwrite Cald to Arderial, another player could not play a<br>
Creature that is too costly to have someone else Dreamwarp it to an<br>
affordable range.<br>
<br>
B: The secondary effects of the Crushing Spell will not happen, since the<br>
Treepsh being discarded from play was not a direct result of the Crushing<br>
card discarding its energy.<br>
<br>
C: The Spell or Power will get to resolve before you could activate the<br>
Pendant's Effect; "after" the opponent uses a Spell or Power means when it<br>
has successfully resolved. the Lahalou would be long discarded before it<br>
could use its Power.<br>
<br>
Also, if a Power has a restriction on when it may be used, then this applies<br>
to opposing turns; for instance, if you have a Power that could only be used<br>
before your Attack step, then if you played Bloom to use the Power on an<br>
opponent's turn, the Power could only be used before their Attack step.<br>

13. Seeing as there's a storyline tournament this weekend, I would like to<br>
have<br>
this answered before then. I was looking at my Bograth deck and a couple of<br>
questions came to mind. Does the sword get pass the Moob Ring and Treepsh<br>
effect? Does "the spell, power, or effect does nothing" mean that your<br>
creatures aren't affected by the spell, power, or effect? Or does the Moob<br>
Ring and Treepsh act like a counterspell or wellisk or sorts? Thanx for any<br>
help you can give.<br>
<br>
RT - The phrase "the Spell, Power, or Effect does nothing" is another way of<br>
saying "prevent all results of the Spell, Power, or Effect". Piercing will<br>
still allow any energy discard to happen, because that cannot be prevented<br>
while it is in effect.<br>

14. This has probably been asked a million times, but just to make sure that<br>
I<br>
am clear:<br>
Dual Region cards are "fully" both regions that are listed on the card.<br>
Though this is pretty clear when it comes to things that affect all X cards,<br>
but what happens when something affects all non-Y cards?<br>
<br>
Here is my example. If I have a Weave/Naroom critter in play and my<br>
opponent casts a spell that affects all non-Weave fuzzballs. Does the Weave<br>
side protect my little dude, or does his Naroom side condemn him? With the<br>
cards that affect a certain region, this is clear... if it is Weave/Cald, it<br>
is Weave and Cald and can be dealt with accordingly. But in this situation<br>
it is Weave and it is Non-Weave, which (though seeming only a difference in<br>
grammar) makes an interpretation difficult.<br>
<br>
Also, Stalking has been discussed at great length but there was something I<br>
was wondering about. It was ruled that Stalking is a "condition" not a<br>
spell/power/effect. But it was also said that the "source" of the stalking<br>
damage is the attacking creature. What happens when a critter of Zannah's<br>
is stalked and attacked? Zannah reads that the first "card" blah blah...<br>
the 1 damage comes from a rule, so it gets past burrowing and the like, but<br>
the "source" is the attacking creature so does that mean it came from that<br>
"card' and is negated?<br>
<br>
I hope these aren't to "rules lawyery" I just have a tourney coming up and I<br>
don't want to be sure what I am going to face/be able to do. Thanks<br>
<br>
RT - A Creature that has more than one region is a Creature of every region<br>
listed. If you have a Cald/Weave Creature and a card affects all non-Weave<br>
Creatures, then it does not affect that multi-region Creature because it is<br>
a Weave Creature. "non-Weave" means lacking Weave, so as long as one region<br>
matches up to Weave, it's unaffected.<br>
<br>
If Zannah's Charm has not been activated previously and one of her stalked<br>
Creatures is attacked, Charm will prevent the one energy from being removed<br>
by stalking, then the attacking Creature will remove energy as normal.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
Marie also asks:<br>
<br>
15. Can you cleanse Crushing Darkness and have a Non-Core, Non-Shadow Magi<br>
cast<br>
it? The card only rules out Shadow-Magi in its casting restriction, unlike<br>
the other Crushings. Though this seems to go past the "intent" there seems<br>
to be a lot of contention on this, so I figured a simple yes/no question<br>
would help.<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, as was ruled in a previous digest, Cleansing Crushing Darkness<br>
opens it up to every non-Core, non-shadow Magi to play. Similarly, any<br>
non-Core Magi with a Mantle of Shadows (barring restrictions such as<br>
Kesia's) could play it.<br>

16. Wellisk uses the wording "Immediately after a Creature is played..."<br>
Does the word "Immediately" mean before any other Effects happen, or<br>
does it work just like all the other triggered Effects?<br>
<br>
RT - It means that you must choose to use Dream Barrier as soon as possible,<br>
before the opponent can perform any other non-triggered actions on their<br>
turn, but after the Creature is successfully played; any other Effects<br>
triggered simultaneously do 'stack' alongside it and resolve normally.<br>
Wellisk uses the wording 'immediately after' instead of 'as another Creature<br>
is played' so that the Creature played will get an opportunity to enter play<br>
and trigger any related Effects, as well as trigger similar Effects for<br>
leaving play.<br>
<br>
For example, the opponent has a Wudge in play and you have a Wellisk. They<br>
spend five energy to play a Chaos Plith. When Chaos Plith enters play, both<br>
Strengthen and Dream Barrier are triggered; Strengthen resolves, as the<br>
opponent is the active player, giving Wudge +1 energy, and then you choose<br>
whether or not to discard the Wellisk and use the rest of Dream Barrier's<br>
effect to discard the Chaos Plith from play.<br>
<br>
As an addition to the above example, if the opponent had a Corrupted Sphor,<br>
taken from you, then the Chaos Plith being discarded by Dream Barrier would<br>
also trigger Scavenge.<br>
<br>
The word 'immediately' serves no functional purpose other than to emphasize<br>
that you must decide whether or not to use the rest of Dream Barrier then,<br>
before anything else aside from a simultaneously triggered Effect can be<br>
played/used.<br>

17. I need this question answered before the storyline tournaments this<br>
weekend. I am confused with the new duel region creatures. Say I'm<br>
using a Keeper Magi like Groll from Kybars Teeth. Groll has a Staff<br>
of Keepers in Play. He names Cald as the region of choice. Groll<br>
then summons a Karkik, a Kybars Teeth/Cald dream creature. Does the<br>
Karkik gain one energy from Groll being a Keeper using the Staff of<br>
Keepers? Or does it just come in as normal?<br>
I am seriously considering playing a duel region deck for storyline<br>
tournament. I need an answer so I'll know how I can make my deck.<br>
<br>
RT - If one of the Creature's regions matches the one named with Staff of<br>
Keepers and the Magi playing the Creature is a Keeper, then the Creature<br>
will gain the one energy bonus.<br>

18. This question came up today. Ullig gets 4 energy when her last<br>
creature in play is discarded, preventing her from suffering out<br>
right defeat if her energy is at zero. Many a KT magi has suffered<br>
that fate due to the high cost of KT creatures. But what about when<br>
an opponent uses an Alaban's Undream power and returns the creature<br>
to the hand? Does Ullig still get 4 energy or is she just instantly<br>
defeated?<br>
I assume that Ullig would be defeated if she was at zero, had no<br>
Dewstone in play, and her last creature was just posessed by some<br>
sort of Abaquist. But if that is not the case, please tell me!<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Ullig will only gain the four energy when her last Creature leaves play<br>
by a discard from play mechanic; this can only happen one of two ways:<br>
<br>
A - The Creature is reduced to zero energy, then the game rules mechanically<br>
remove it from play to the discard pile.<br>
<br>
B - A card specifically says to "discard" the Creature from play.<br>
<br>
If a card leaves play by any other means, such as being returned to hand,<br>
shuffled into a player's deck, etc., it does not trigger Fearless, because<br>
it is not leaving play from a discard mechanic (note that Undertow discards<br>
a Creature from play, :then: shuffles it into the deck).<br>
<br>
Also, a Creature who switches controllers does not leave play at any point,<br>
nor does it enter play when it goes to the new player's control. In the case<br>
you mentioned above, if she has no energy and her only remaining Creature is<br>
stolen, she is defeated.<br>

19. I've heard that if you use a Power on a Creature that depletes its<br>
energy<br>
(Vulbor's Power takes all three energy from it) , the Power doesn't work.<br>
And<br>
I've heard that when you use a Power on a Creature that depletes its energy,<br>
the Power DOES work. I'm very confused and this is very important.<br>
<br>
RT - From the April 15th rules digest:<br>
<br>
The Power still happens normally; if the Power affects the now discarded<br>
Creature (such as a Xyx Minor trying to use Gathering Clouds on itself with<br>
only two energy), then the Power will still happen, it just will not be able<br>
to show any result. If that same Xyx Minor spent all of its energy to use<br>
Gathering Clouds on a different Xyx, then the surviving Xyx would receive<br>
the four energy, regardless of the Creature using the Power being discarded.<br>
<br>
Marie writes again:<br>
<br>
20. First:<br>
On Siphon Vortex, what exactly do you get back? The card I have (which is<br>
1st ed, and this may have been cleared up in reprinting) states "discard X<br>
energy from that creature. Add that energy to your Magi." This wording is<br>
confusing. Do you do X damage and gain X energy (regardless if one of them<br>
is prevented) or do you gain the energy that is removed (ala the use of the<br>
phrase "that energy")?<br>
<br>
Here is why I ask. Last night, a Siphon Vortex was cast on my Furok. I had<br>
a Fird Stone in play and spent the two energy to make the spell do nothing<br>
to my Furok. Should the Magi have gained any energy back? If you deal X<br>
and gain X, the Magi would still get it because they are two separate parts<br>
of the spell. But if "that energy" implies the discarded amount, the Magi<br>
would have gotten none because the Fird Stone protected the puppy... I<br>
think. Well, that is why I am asking. And if it is the latter of the two<br>
examples, and you have a Scroll of Fire the Magi would gain the extra energy<br>
discarded by that, right? Since you would be gaining the discarded amount.<br>
<br>
Second:<br>
Can you Bloom/Bahza's Pendant twice in response to one triggering occurance?<br>
As in, if my opponent plays a relic and I have a Bahza's Pendant in play and<br>
a Bloom in my hand, can I activate both of them to use two powers on cards I<br>
have in play (or anything else that I could trigger using them)?<br>
<br>
Third:<br>
When does Stalking damage happen? It says that it is "before energy is<br>
removed" but since it is not an effect so I am not sure where it falls in<br>
priority order (my effects, then my opponent's effects, etc.). It came up<br>
because I attacked a Stalked creature with Weave. The creature only had one<br>
energy, so did the Stalking go off before the creature could Weave its one<br>
energy over to one of its friends (dirty, cheatin' grass-varmints...<br>
mumble... grumble...)?<br>
<br>
RT - Answers below:<br>
<br>
First: Syphon Vortex's most recent printing says "move X energy from an<br>
opposing Creature to your Magi". With a move/transfer effect, the card<br>
discards the amount from the target and also adds the amount to the<br>
receiving card, but both results are dependent on each other. If the energy<br>
discard is amplified or reduced, it changes the amount of energy gained If<br>
the energy loss is completely negated, so is the energy gain.<br>
<br>
Second: As long as all conditions are met, you may use any card that can<br>
qualify. When the opponent uses a Spell or Power, you may activate not only<br>
Bazha's Pendant, but play as many Blooms in hand as you have.<br>
<br>
As a similar example, playing a Creature would trigger all copies of Reef<br>
Hyren's Rebuke in play, and each could be used to discard two energy from<br>
the Creature played. As long as all triggering qualifications are met, one<br>
event can create a chain of reactions.<br>
<br>
Third: Both stalking and Weave are triggered by a Creature being attacked;<br>
the active player's effects will resolve first, and normally the stalked<br>
Creature will lose the energy before it can Weave it away, defeating it if<br>
it only has one. Conversely, if you could somehow attack an opposing<br>
Creature on their turn, Weave would resolve first, as they are the active<br>
player, then the stalking energy removal will happen.<br>

keeps the rule able to cover out-of-turn powers).<br>

RT - You may use Dreamwarp to increase or decrease the value of its starting<br>

the Creature or Magi required to do so; this energy removal is not energy<br>

3. Can someone explain the second regions on Nightmare's Dawn cards to<br>
me?<br>
<br>
RT - When a card has a second region, then it functions exactly the same as<br>
a single region card of both different regions within the context of the<br>
rules.<br>
<br>
For a Creature, this means that Magi of either region may play the Creature<br>
without paying regional penalties.<br>
<br>
For a Relic, this means that a Magi of either region can play it.<br>
<br>
For Magi, it means they can play cards of either of their regions without<br>
penalty or restriction.<br>
<br>
Additionally, when a card effect refers to a card type of either region on a<br>
multi-region card matching the named card type, then it affects that card<br>
normally.<br>
<br>
For instance, a Cald/Weave Creature cannot be affected by a Firefly Swarm,<br>
as Firefly Swarm cannot affect Cald Creatures.<br>
<br>
Conversely, an Arderial/Naroom Creature could be affected by Call of the<br>
Wild on Essence of Naroom since it is a Naroom Creature.<br>
<br>

4. If I have a corrupted pylofuf and I place Agram's Armor on it does it<br>
loose no energy in attacks? Because Pylofuf says it MAY only loose two<br>
energy in attacks and spells and powers per turn. Agram's Armor says<br>
that the chosen creature looses 2 less. So if it will loose 2 and 2<br>
less, it means that it looses no energy right?<br>
<br>
RT - Effects that alter the amount of energy being lost are always applied<br>
before those that limit the energy loss. The same goes for things that alter<br>
card costs and those that halve or limit the costs of the cards.<br>
<br>
Therefore, the amount of energy assigned to be removed in the attack by the<br>
opposing Creature will be reduced by two because of the Armor, then the<br>
amount left will be reduced to a maximum of two by Burrow.<br>

Effect - Vile Herald: Bograth and Core Magi can play both Core<br>
Creatures and Bograth Creatures, ignoring regional penalties and<br>
restrictions.<br>
Effect - Escape: If Gwaeg is defeated while defending, place it into<br>
your hand instead of your discard pile.<br>
Only Bograth Magi or Core Magi can play Gwaeg.<br>
<br>
Does Gwaeg return to your hand if a spell, power or effect discards<br>
it? What if I discard it to use the Moob ring? Some people in my<br>
area say the text on Gwaeg means that the Creature only returns to<br>
your hand when it is attacked.<br>
<br>
RT - When a card refers to a Creature having to be 'defeated while<br>
defending', then it means the Creature must be attacked and reduced to zero<br>
energy at any time during the attack.<br>
<br>
If a one energy Gwaeg were attacked by a Lahalou with three energy, then<br>
when both Creatures removed energy from each other normally, the Gwaeg would<br>
be defeated while defending, and return to its owners hand.<br>
<br>
If the same example above happened and the Gwaeg was stalked, making it lose<br>
its one energy before energy is normally discarded, it would be defeated<br>
while defending (because the definition of defeat is simply to be reduced to<br>
zero energy), and would return to its owners hand.<br>
<br>
If the Gwaeg was attacked and you chose to discard it to fulfill another<br>
card Effect, for instance, a card that said "Effect - You're Mean: When one<br>
of your Bograth Creatures is attacked, you may discard it from play before<br>
energy is removed to make the attacking player feel bad.", then it would not<br>
be 'defeated while defending', because it was discarded directly from play<br>
and was not reduced to zero energy, and it would stay in the discard pile.<br>

6. Came up and while we read the Unoffical MRP of the Syphon Vortex in<br>
which is now reads "Move X energy from an Opposing Creature to your<br>
Magi" We wish to be totally clear on somethings.<br>
<br>
Is moving Energy is the same as saying "Discard Energy from A and Add<br>
Energy to B?" If so does Move then trigger Amanax's power?<br>
<br>
For Syphon Vortex can X be greater than the energy of the target<br>
Creature?<br>
<br>
For Syphon Vortex if Amanax targets a 6e Creature in play and spends<br>
14e to cast Syphon Vortex (X being 10), Does he get only 12E back (6<br>
for the SV and 6 for his Effect)? or 20e (X being 10+ 10 for his<br>
effect).<br>
<br>
Syphon Vortex vs. Rock Hyren: Rock Hyren has 11e and his Effect<br>
Invulnability: Loose 2 less Energy from Spells. Can SV be cast for<br>
17e, X being 13 to kill the Rock Hyren, or is X limited to the amount<br>
of energy on the Creature? And how much energy does the Magi get<br>
back, the 11 or 13e.<br>
<br>
RT - The MRP is official; Syphon Vortex was reprinted just before Dream's<br>
End in the Cald demo deck with the text previously mentioned in the last<br>
Rules Digest.<br>
<br>
A move effect is the same as 'discard X amount to add X amount'. This means<br>
that Amanax can receive energy from using a Syphon Vortex.<br>
<br>
You may place more energy into a Syphon Vortex than the target has.<br>
<br>
If Amanax were to use Syphon Vortex on a Creature with six energy, spending<br>
ten energy for the X portion of the Vortex's cost, he would gain twelve<br>
energy, because he can only move six from the Creature to himself, and then<br>
he would only gain the six energy discarded by the Spell with his Effect.<br>
<br>
As stated before, you can make X as high as you can afford, and the Syphon<br>
Vortex will attempt to discard X energy, adding back an amount to your Magi<br>
equal to what was actually discarded. Invulnerability will stop the first<br>
two 'points' of the Vortex, then the excess will get through. If it is<br>
enough to discard the Hyren, then it will do so, and the Magi will receive<br>
an amount of energy equal to how much was actually discarded. In the example<br>
given, the Hyren would be discarded, and the Magi would regain eleven<br>
energy.<br>

state at the end of the turn? I want to say that yes the fang can be<br>
targeted but I'm not exactly certain how to answer the second half since<br>
while the Fang is no longer a creature, it didnt actually leave play. This<br>
would lead me to say the spells stay in place but it all hinges on getting<br>
the Fang into creature form in the first place.<br>
<br>
RT - Neither Dream or Nightmare Channel require the cards that they are<br>
attached to keep the same card type indefinitely; while this may be changed<br>
in a future printing, the Channels will stay attached to the Fang when it<br>
reverts to a Relic, and while it may be an expensive means to do so, a near<br>
indestructible improved Water of Life is quite handy for Kybar's Teeth.<br>
<br>
Another note on Dream/Nightmare Channel and other attached cards; unless<br>
they specifically alter a condition of the card they are attached to in some<br>
manner, they do not affect the card. This means that a Dream or Nightmare<br>
Channel may be attached to a Creature like Lovian that could normally be<br>
unaffected by certain Spells, because both Channels affect a Magi only.<br>
<br>
A climbing Staff could then be discarded at any time to stop a Nightmare<br>
Channel (or even Dream Channel) from affecting that Magi permanently,<br>
because it is the only thing affected by the Spell, whereas a Climbing Staff<br>
could not be discarded if the opponent tries to attach a Corrupt to a Magi,<br>
since the Corrupt will affect the next Creature played, and does nothing to<br>
the Magi.<br>

Discard the chosen Creature from play.<br>
<br>
It was in dispute whether Cark Cragnoc had to have energy equal to (or<br>
greater than) the chosen Creature's energy in order to use the Power. I had<br>
to rule, "No." based on the wording. At the same time I thought that made<br>
the Power pretty tough, not over powerful, but very tough. Is it the intent<br>
of the card to work in this manner?<br>
<br>
<br>
Another question I have is more to confirm how Dewstone works with Kyg'n.<br>
If Kyg'n has no energy and no Creatures in play, he is not defeated until he<br>
gets attacked due to his Effect - True Grit. Kyg'n also has a Dewstone in<br>
play. He gets attacked and discards the Dewstone. At what point does Kyg'n<br>
get the 5 energy? Does he get defeated when the attack is declared so he<br>
gains the 5 energy before energy is removed? Does he gain the 5 energy<br>
after energy is removed? The way we have been playing it is that he gets<br>
the energy after energy is removed since the Creature has already attacked<br>
it cannot remove energy again so Kyg'n would gain the 5 an then have to be<br>
attacked a minimum of two more times to defeat him. This does make Kyg'n<br>
even tougher, but it appears to make the most sense. Can you please<br>
clarify?<br>
<br>
RT - Dark Cragnoc must discard energy equal to the amount on the Creature,<br>
no more, no less; if this discards the Cragnoc from play, Cremate still<br>
occurs.<br>
<br>
If Kyg'n has no energy in play, then he is defeated immediately as a<br>
Creature is declared to attack him, before any other card effects that are<br>
triggered by an attack being declared would occur. This is because "until"<br>
makes him not be defeated until the specific moment in time that a Creature<br>
is declared to attack him, even before Effects triggered by an attack may<br>
occur.<br>
<br>
Normally, a Dewstone would let you discard it at any time a Magi has no<br>
energy in play, between the time that event happens and the time in which<br>
the rules say "this Magi is defeated". Gulp is an Effect triggered by the<br>
state of a Magi having no energy in play, and it lets the player decide<br>
whether or not to use the Effect; the fact that the game is waiting for an<br>
Effect to finish its resolution is what is stopping the Magi from being<br>
declared as defeated, since all pending card effects must be resolved before<br>
a Magi is checked for defeat. The text saying 'before your Magi is defeated'<br>
is almost redundant, because it is there only as a reminder, and does not<br>
actually cause Gulp to put everything on 'pause' so that it may be used<br>
every time a Magi has no energy in play.<br>
<br>
Kyg'n can use Gulp at any time after he is reduced to zero energy. However,<br>
if he waits until he is attacked without doing so, his text immediately<br>
declares him as defeated, and the Dewstone is discarded with no effect,<br>
along with his other cards in play.<br>

like everyone gets a freebie this time.)<br>

Choose any one opposing PLAYER. The chosen player reveals his or her hand<br>

I was wondering if you could use it on your first turn if you had the chance<br>

RT - Cards in the hand, deck, and discard pile are the player's; cards in<br>
play are the Magi's. If you have a card effect that refers to any out of<br>
play area (hand, deck, or discard pile), you may use it even if the opposing<br>
player has no Magi active.<br>
<br>
This means you may use Secrets on a player who does not have an opposing<br>
Magi, but they are unlikely to have cards in hand for you to check. If you<br>
had just played something like a Vortex of Knowledge, then the opponent<br>
could have Creatures or non-Creature Naroom cards in hand for you to view,<br>
and then draw cards for. If you just wanted to discard three energy from<br>
your Magi to use Secrets for no benefit, however, you may.<br>

each Taunt you have used on a Sabertooth Jumbor that turn will add one<br>
energy to the Creature. In your example, each Flying Hinko will gain two<br>
energy after defeating the Eebits.<br>
<br>
Taunt is a Naroom Power, and when it adds energy to a Creature, it will<br>
trigger each Flying Hinko's Empower. Empower will give four energy after<br>
each of the attacks in the example given:<br>

First Taunt - +1 to Magi with Empower<br>
Second Taunt - +1 to Magi with Empower<br>

things are obvious, like not taking 1 damage from Shimmer's Creature<br>

Also, if a Carillion attacked a 2e Krawg, would the Krawg be immune<br>
to Trample and thus inflict full damage to the Carillion?<br>

RT - Being 'stalked' is a condition generated by a game mechanic; it does<br>
not discard energy as a Spell, Power, Effect, but by the Creature attacking<br>
the stalked Creature. Krawg will lose the energy from being Stalked<br>
normally. If an Effect discards additional energy based on the Creature<br>
being stalked, then that extra energy discard would not happen.<br>

Trample does not affect Krawg, it affects the Carillion; the Carillion would<br>

22. Based on the current ruling of Flame Trulb having to be in play first<br>
for it<br>
's Effect to trigger and itself counted as a Creature for this purpose, I<br>
have come up with similar situations and related questions:<br>
<br>
When you play an Alpine Xamf does it gain the benefit of its own Effect and<br>
does it gain 2 energy for being a Kybar's Teeth /and/ a Naroom Creature?<br>
<br>
When you take control of a Corathan (with Turn, River Abiquist, Crushing<br>
Darkness, etc.) does its Effect trigger so you can search your own discard<br>
pile for a Core or Orothe card and place it in your hand?<br>
<br>
When you take control of a Karak Necklace or Band (say with Hubdra's Cube or<br>
Crushing Surf) do you to draw 2 cards or gain 2 energy?<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are more, but you get the idea of where I'm going with this.<br>
Basically, if Flame Trulb has to be in play to trigger its Effect, do other<br>
cards have to do the same? Also, Can cards trigger their own Effects when<br>
you play/take control of them?<br>
<br>
RT - Answers below:<br>
<br>
Alpine Xamf - "Whenever you play". By the time the Xamf is in play, it has<br>
already been played (bear with me, I'll explain); 'whenever you play' refers<br>
to the moment a card of the appropriate type leaves your hand and is<br>
scheduled to enter the playing field. This is when the Xamf's Effect<br>
triggers. Once the card successfully enters the playing field, the Xamf's<br>
Effect finishes resolving, and adds energy to the Creature, if it can. Also,<br>
all Effects on the card played become active; this is when 'when xxxx enters<br>
play' Effects are triggered. So the Xamf gets nothing for itself when it<br>
enters play, but the Trulb is already in play and can count itself.<br>
<br>
Taking control of a card with a theft bonus - You technically gain control<br>
of the Effect immediately after you gain control of the Creature (or Relic,<br>
in the Karak Jewelry's case); as such, it doesn't recognize that you have<br>
stolen the card it's printed on and you get no benefit for that instance of<br>
theft. This is similar to what would happen if Morag used Theft to take a<br>
Karak Band; he would gain no energy.<br>

vaporize in hole or in part. Is this correct?<br>
<br>
RT - Answers below:<br>
<br>
A - If she follows the Dark Twins, she becomes a Naroom Shadow Magi. This is<br>
because the Twins specifically say the Magi becomes only a Naroom Shadow<br>
Magi.<br>
<br>
However, if she follows Nagsis, she becomes a dual Cald Shadow Magi/Naroom<br>
Shadow Magi, since Nagsis only says that the Magi becomes a Shadow Magi of<br>
their original region. Since both Cald and Naroom are her original region,<br>
she becomes both Cald Shadow and Naroom Shadow.<br>
<br>
B - The only Spells that Climbing Staff can stop are ones that solely<br>
affects a Magi or a player's hand; Vaporize affects both the Magi and their<br>
Relics, so it could not stop Vaporize, or any part of it.<br>

26. My opponent is using Sorreah and plays Storm of Fishes naming relics.<br>
Do I have time to use the Climbing Staff in my hand against Sorreah's<br>
effect?<br>
<br>
RT - Because Climbing Staff gives the broad range of "whenever", if an<br>
active continuous Effect is affecting only your Magi, then as long as the<br>
Effect is active there is no moment in time that you cannot discard a<br>
Climbing Staff from your hand or from play, with the exception of when it is<br>
being discarded by something else.<br>
<br>
In the situation you mentioned, the very last moment you could discard it<br>
would be when the Spell is played, but before it resolves. Once it starts<br>
resolving, the hands are revealed and then the Relics (or Spells) are<br>
discarded without a "pause" to throw the Staff away and shut down Sorreah.<br>

27. Can a Magi grab an alternate version of a card listed in his/her<br>
starting<br>
cards?<br>
For example, could Evil Evu (starting: Furok, Plith, Dream Rift) grab a Dark<br>
Furok and a Chaos Plith as they are alternate Furok and Plith respectively?<br>
<br>
RT - An Alternate of a card is that card as far as the rules are concerned.<br>
You can only have three Furoks in a deck, for example, so you could not play<br>
three Furoks and three Dark Furoks; similarly, Evu can start with Dark Furok<br>
and Evil Evu can start with a normal Furok. If there were a Magi that<br>
started with Ash Hyren, then they could start with Darkbreed's Minion<br>
instead.<br>
<br>
Also, since cards with "STARTING: xxxx Magi" are considered to be printed on<br>
that Magi, then the Magi may also start with an Alternate of that card.<br>
<br>
For example, Krawg has "STARTING: Ashgar". Because the rules say that<br>
"Ashgar" and "Good Ol' Ashgar" are the same because "Good Ol' Ashgar" is an<br>
Alternate Ashgar (technically speaking), then either of those Magi may start<br>
with Krawg. If an Alternate Krawg was later printed, then either Ashgar or<br>
good Ol' Ashgar would be able to choose Krawg or the Alternate Krawg as a<br>
starting card.<br>
<br>
Similarly, if there were a means of adding "STARTING: Any Cald Magi" to an<br>
Ash Hyren, then any Cald Magi could start with either Ash Hyren or<br>
Darkbreed's Minion.<br>

Probably<br>
not, but I need to verify it. And lastly, I play a Stealth on one of my<br>
creatures and attack an opposing creature, but my opponent has Rayje's Sword<br>
out. Stealth would still work because it isn't reducing energy loss (well,<br>
it<br>
is, but it's not saying that), right? Thanks.<br>
<br>
RT - Evade only reduces energy loss; any energy prevention in excess of the<br>
energy loss assigned is lost.<br>
<br>
As for Stealth, it does not reduce energy loss; it lets your Creature remove<br>
energy from the opposing Creature before they can remove energy from your<br>
Creature, and though the energy amount removed is now lower, at no point was<br>
energy loss reduced within the context of the rules.<br>
<br>
For a more detailed explanation of how Piercing works, see below.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
---------------------------------------------------<br>
SPECIAL: Piercing (Rayje's Sword)<br>
<br>
Rayje's Sword<br>
Universal Relic<br>
Cost: 0<br>
Effect - Piercing: Spells, Powers, and Effects do not reduce energy loss.<br>
<br>
RT - There has been some confusion lately as to what exactly Piercing can<br>
and cannot do, with regards to some common and uncommon card effects.<br>
<br>
A. Indirect Energy Loss Prevention<br>
<br>
If a Spell, Power, or Effect, named or not, grants a Creature or Magi a<br>
mechanic that reduces energy loss, then the Spell, Power, or Effect is<br>
indirectly reducing the energy loss, and Piercing lets the energy loss<br>
happen unaltered. A good example of this is seen in Burrow.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: Burrow - Being burrowed, generally speaking, is a game mechanic,<br>
and part of the rules; it is not a Spell, Power, or Effect. However, the<br>
status is almost always granted by a Spell (such as the Spell Burrow) or<br>
Effect (such as the Effect - Burrow), and is indirectly reducing energy<br>
loss. If Pylofuf were worded as follows:<br>
<br>
Pylofuf<br>
Underneath Creature<br>
Starting Energy: 5<br>
Pylofuf is burrowed; it cannot attack and loses no more than two energy per<br>
turn from attacks and your opponents' Spells and Powers.<br>
Underneath Shadow Magi may play Pylofuf.<br>
<br>
Then Piercing would not prevent the Pylofuf's 'burrowed' status from<br>
reducing the energy loss, because a Spell, Power, or Effect, indirectly or<br>
not, is not reducing the energy loss.<br>
<br>
B. Being unaffected by Spells, Powers, and/or Effects of a certain type.<br>
<br>
If a Creature or Magi is unaffected (or not affected) by a Spell, Power,<br>
and/or Effect, or that Spells, Powers, and/or Effects of or not of a certain<br>
type do nothing, then that is exactly the same as saying that all results of<br>
the Spell, Power, and/or Effect are prevented. If the Spell, Power, and/or<br>
Effect prevented would discard energy as any part of the Spell, Power, or<br>
Effect result, Piercing allows the Spell, Power, or Effect to discard energy<br>
normally, though anything else the Spell, Power, or Effect does is<br>
prevented.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Protection (Shadow Cloak) - Protection says "Each of your Core<br>
Creatures in play is not affected by non-Core Spells and Powers until the<br>
end of your next turn." Normally, if a player used a Storm Cloud, which<br>
discards all but one energy from the chosen Creature, on a Creature under<br>
the effects of Protection, then the energy removal would be prevented.<br>
Because Protection is a Power trying to reduce energy loss, Piercing<br>
overrides it and the Storm Cloud discards energy as normal.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Resistance (Lovian) - Resistance says "Non-Arderial Spells and<br>
Powers do not affect Lovian." Because of this, if a player used Firefly<br>
Swarm on the Lovian, which discards two energy from a non-Cald Creature and<br>
does not allow that Creature to attack on its controller's next turn,<br>
normally nothing would happen. With Piercing in effect, the Firefly Swarm<br>
will get to discard its two energy, ignoring the Effect -Resistance in that<br>
regard, but the Lovian's Effect will still keep the Firefly Swarm from not<br>
allowing it to attack on its controller's next turn.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 3: Unnamed Effect (Climbing Staff) - The unnamed Effect says "You<br>
may discard Climbing Staff from your hand or from play whenever an opposing<br>
Spell, Power, or Effect is affecting only your Magi or only your hand. The<br>
Spell, Power, or Effect does nothing." If a single Magi is affected by a<br>
Maelstrom, and a Climbing Staff is discarded to stop the energy removal,<br>
then Piercing will allow the Maelstrom to discard energy as normal, because<br>
the energy loss is trying to be reduced by an Effect, named or not.<br>
<br>
C. Replacement Effects<br>
<br>
If a card sets the amount of energy to be discarded in an attack to a fixed<br>
amount, and that fixed amount is less than what the Creature would normally<br>
discard (i.e., the Creature's energy total), this is NOT energy loss<br>
prevention, and Piercing does not affect it.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: Regal Presence (Elder Yark) - "Whenever an opposing Creature<br>
attacks, it removes energy from the defending Creature equal to either its<br>
starting energy or current energy, whichever is less." If a Wudge with four<br>
energy attacks the Elder Yark, then the amount of energy it would discard,<br>
four, is replaced with the amount of the Wudge's starting energy, as it is<br>
less than its current energy. This is a replacement effect, not energy loss<br>
prevention; Regal Presence does not let the Wudge assign four to be removed<br>
then reduce that amount to one, it instead lets the Wudge assign one energy<br>
to be removed. If the Elder Yark were worded as follows:<br>
<br>
Elder Yark<br>
Arderial/Kybar's Teeth Dream Creature<br>
Starting Energy: 7<br>
Effect: Regal Presence - Whenever an opposing Creature attacks, reduce the<br>
amount of energy it removes from the defending Creature to either the<br>
attacking Creature's starting energy or current energy, whichever is less.<br>
Effect: Invulnerability - Elder Yark loses one less energy in attacks.<br>
<br>
Then Piercing would stop Regal Presence from reducing the loss.<br>
Incidentally, Piercing does keep Invulnerability from reducing energy loss.<br>
<br>
D. Piercing vs. Lockdown style effects.<br>
<br>
If a card does not let you use a Spell, Power, or Effect that discards<br>
energy, then Piercing does not circumvent that restriction.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: Smolder (Darkbreed's Minion) - "Whenever a player draws a card,<br>
discard one energy from each of that player's Creatures in play. Darkbreed's<br>
Minion loses no energy from this Effect."<br>
<br>
If an opponent used Rayje's Belt to Lockdown Smolder, then Piercing would<br>
not allow it to discard energy as normal, because Smolder cannot be used at<br>
all, so there is no energy loss reduction. As a side note, if Smolder could<br>
be used, the Darkbreed's minion would lose energy as well, while Piercing is<br>
in effect.<br>
<br>
E. Piercing vs. Lockdown prevention effects.<br>
<br>
Piercing does not stop a player from using a Spell, Power, or Effect that<br>
reduces energy loss; it instead makes the energy loss reduction portion of<br>
the Spell, Power, or Effect do nothing.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: Unnamed Effect (Rayje's Cloak) - Rayje's Cloak's Effect is worded<br>
as:<br>
<br>
"Opposing cards neither prevent your Creatures from attacking nor prevent<br>
opposing cards from defending. Opposing cards do not prevent your cards from<br>
using their Powers or Effects."<br>
<br>
If a player has a Rayje's Sword in play and they attack an opponent's<br>
Pylofuf, if the defending player has a Rayje's Cloak in play, then Piercing<br>
still stops the Pylofuf's Burrow from reducing the energy loss of the<br>
attack. This is because Piercing does not prevent the Creature from using<br>
Burrow, it prevents Burrow from reducing any energy loss.<br>

discard energy or add any.<br>

prevent the OTHER card from being discarded by Beam of Light that<br>

<br>
RT - If you have let your opponent get to the point where they are choosing<br>
what the Beam of Light is affecting, then it is too late to use Time Lapse.<br>
<br>
Time Lapse states "whenever an opponent plays a card you may discard Phrup<br>
from play". This means when they actually play it but before any choices are<br>
made, such as playing the Beam of Light, but before they choose two Phrups.<br>
<br>
If they did not pause to give you an opportunity to Time Lapse the Beam,<br>
declaring they would use it on the two Phrups before you had the chance to<br>
say you were Time Lapsing it, then you may force them to allow you to use<br>
Time Lapse, even with the knowledge of what they intended. But if they have<br>
given you the opportunity to use Time Lapse, you declined, and then they<br>
decided to affect one of your Phrups, it is too late to decide and use Time<br>
Lapse.<br>

3. What happens if I attack a Elder Yark under Kioko's control with a<br>

<br>
RT - As soon as the Granas is declared as attacking the Elder Yark, the<br>
following trigger:<br>
<br>
Sneak Attack - Attacker (Attacking Player)<br>
Sneak Attack - Defender (Attacking Player)<br>
Motivate (Defending Player)<br>
Demotivate (Defending Player)<br>
Regal Presence (Defending Player)<br>
<br>
The attacking player is the active player, and would choose to resolve all<br>
of their effects first. If they wanted Sneak Attack to make the attacker or<br>
defender discard its starting energy instead of its current energy, then<br>
they'd choose to do so. Then, the defending player, as the inactive player,<br>
resolves their effects, and chooses whether or not to Motivate or<br>
Demotivate, and when to resolve Regal Presence. If Regal Presence is<br>
resolved first, Demotivate can still be used to change the amount to be<br>
discarded back to the starting energy, if the defender happens to want the<br>
attacking Creature to discard more energy.<br>

Effectively, the defending player will "win out" in what they want to<br>
happen.<br>

4. I'm not going to dispute the fact that Sword would allow a Firefly Swarm<br>
to inflict damage on a Lovian (though I don't really agree that it would,<br>
I'm not going to argue it right now). HOWEVER:<br>
<br>
I will argue that, even given the assumption that sword *would* allow FS to<br>
inflict the damage, you would not be able to target the lovian with the<br>
spell, due to his text "Non-Arderial Spells do not affect Lovian."<br>
Somewhere, as I understand it, RT has added a rule that you cannot play a<br>
spell that does not have a legal target, meaning that if Lovian is the only<br>
creature in play, normally I cannot even PLAY the firefly swarm. (I could<br>
not find this ruling to quote, unfortunately, and if I am misquoting it, the<br>
rest of this discussion may be moot.) Therefore, it seems to me that, even<br>
with a sword in play, the Firefly Swarm cannot affect the lovian, therefore<br>
cannot target it, therefore never has the opportunity to *try* to do damage<br>
that would then be modified by the Sword. The sword does not explicitly<br>
override targeting restrictions as far as I can tell.<br>
<br>
What am I missing?<br>
<br>
RT - To quote the Rules Team:<br>
<br>
On the Beam of Light issue:<br>
In the same way that you can't choose a Lovian with a Thunderquake or<br>
Undertow, or choose a Colossus or Deep Wellisk with a Shockwave, you cannot<br>
choose the Tomes, Fang, or Vault with a Beam of Light.<br>
<br>
Magi-Nation has, since the beginning, used an 'effects-based' timing/rulings<br>
system. The most basic tenet of this system is that the end result of a card<br>
ability is more important than any of its parts. In the case of Lovian vs.<br>
Firefly Swarm, Resistance has the end result of preventing each of the<br>
Swarm's effects. Piercing disallows the prevention of energy loss, and so<br>
the Lovian loses two energy. For Beam of Light vs. Tomes, the Tomes can't be<br>
chosen since the Beam can't possibly affect the Tomes (since all it's trying<br>
to do is discard the Tomes).<br>
<br>
You aren't allowed to play a Spell that wouldn't do anything, so if the only<br>
possible victims of your Tquake are Lovians, then the Spell sits in your<br>
hand. If the only Relics in play are Tomes and a Relic Stalker, the little<br>
guy doesn't pitter patter anywhere.<br>

6. Hmm, here is an interesting one that came up last night...<br>
<br>
Say Tryn Flamesaver activates her power to make the next Naroom spell that<br>
adds energy discard it instead.<br>
<br>
Then she casts Sap of Life on a critter with a starting energy of 10 that<br>
currently has 5 on it. The amount the Sap would refill would be 5 and<br>
because of her power it would then discard it, killing the creature.<br>
<br>
But, here is why I am asking: Sap of Life does not specify how much is<br>
added, in fact it uses the phrase "restore...to its starting energy." The<br>
reason I tried this was because it would in fact be gaining energy, and<br>
would seem to be affected by her power to turn that into damage.<br>
<br>
But I could also see it not working because it "restores" instead of "gain X<br>
amount."<br>
<br>
So what happens here, or with spells like this?<br>
<br>
RT - The phrase "restore a Creature to its starting energy" is shorthand for<br>
"set the chosen Creature's energy at its starting energy". Most restoration<br>
effects specify that you must choose a Creature with less than its starting<br>
energy to be affected. Therefore, the restore ability would be adding energy<br>
to the Creature, making it eligible to be affected by Tryn's Energy<br>
Substitution (if it's a Naroom card producing the restoration).<br>

8. The current rulings for States/Conditions are unclear and<br>
contradictory. Here are the relevant passages from the recent rules<br>
digest:<br>
<br>
(Stalking a Krawg)<br>
<br>
RT - Being 'stalked' is a condition generated by a game mechanic; it<br>
does not discard energy as a Spell, Power, Effect, but by the Creature<br>
attacking the stalked Creature. Krawg will lose the energy from being<br>
Stalked<br>
normally. If an Effect discards additional energy based on the<br>
Creature being stalked, then that extra energy discard would not happen.<br>
<br>
If there were a Paradwyn creature that had "Effecct - Stalk: Whenever<br>
this creature attacks, the opposing creature is stalked. Stalked<br>
creatures..."<br>
<br>
I assume in this case the Krawg would ignore it?<br>
<br>
<br>
(Piercing a Pylofuf)<br>
<br>
A. Indirect Energy Loss Prevention<br>
<br>
If a Spell, Power, or Effect, named or not, grants a Creature or<br>
Magi a mechanic that reduces energy loss, then the Spell, Power, or Effect<br>
is indirectly reducing the energy loss, and Piercing lets the energy<br>
loss happen unaltered. A good example of this is seen in Burrow.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE: Burrow - Being burrowed, generally speaking, is a game<br>
mechanic, and part of the rules; it is not a Spell, Power, or Effect.<br>
However,<br>
the status is almost always granted by a Spell (such as the Spell<br>
Burrow) or Effect (such as the Effect - Burrow), and is indirectly reducing<br>
energy loss. If Pylofuf were worded as follows:<br>
<br>
Pylofuf<br>
Underneath Creature<br>
Starting Energy: 5<br>
Pylofuf is burrowed; it cannot attack and loses no more than two<br>
energy per turn from attacks and your opponents' Spells and Powers.<br>
Underneath Shadow Magi may play Pylofuf.<br>
<br>
Then Piercing would not prevent the Pylofuf's 'burrowed' status from<br>
reducing the energy loss, because a Spell, Power, or Effect,<br>
indirectly or not, is not reducing the energy loss.<br>
<br>
<br>
The problem is that Burrowed is also a "Condition generated by a Game<br>
Mechanic" (in this case, an Effect called Burrow). This has been<br>
mentioned in the past. But it isn't worded as such.<br>
<br>
I guess the introduction of the "state" of being stalked has clouded<br>
the burrowing issue. Maybe other states that are introduced should do<br>
things like the following (possible reword for Jungle Jile?):<br>
<br>
Power - Mass Stalk (2): All opposing creatures gain "Effect - Stalked:<br>
When this creature is attacked, it loses 1E before energy is removed."<br>
<br>
This would make Stalking fit into the framework of<br>
Powers/Spells/Effects better. It also would not change the Stalked<br>
Krawg ruling (because the Krawg itself would gain the effect, thus not<br>
being an opposing effect).<br>
<br>
RT - As the rules team has stated previously, when a Creature attacks a<br>
stalked Creature, the source of the energy removal has nothing to do with<br>
what gave the defender the 'stalked' condition, it comes from the attacking<br>
Creature, and is discarded by a game mechanic, not a Spell, Power, Effect,<br>
or attack. This does make stalking unique, and fairly difficult to counter,<br>
once a Creature is actually stalked.<br>
<br>
The source of the 'stalked' condition can and generally does come from a<br>
Spell, Power, or Effect; the question asked was not regarding the Krawg<br>
gaining the 'stalked' condition, but whether or not it were immune to<br>
stalking energy loss once it was stalked. If an opposing Effect tried to<br>
give the Krawg the stalked condition, then the Krawg would not become<br>
stalked.<br>
<br>
All precedents have ruled that Burrow is attached to the Spell, Power, or<br>
Effect that grants it. Stalked is a uniquely different mechanic, and the<br>
energy removal is attached to the Creature attacking the stalked Creature,<br>
nothing else.<br>

RT - 'Move' is shorthand for 'discard from one place, then add to another'.<br>
These values are not linked; increasing the amount of energy discarded as<br>
part of a 'move' (with Scroll of Fire, Intensify, Blast Gloves, or any<br>

If a player has a Magi in play that has no Creatures, Relics, or Spells in<br>
play do they benefit from this card? Technically the Magi has no cards in<br>
play so they should not benefit from it. Is this correct?<br>
<br>
RT - If a Magi has no cards in play when Nightmare's Dawn is played, they<br>
have no cards to compare regions with their Magi, and would be able to gain<br>
nothing.<br>

1. What happens if you control two or three minion's in play? The effect<br>
says<br>
that the Darkbreed's Minion is immune to this effect. Does that mean that<br>
it's immune to its own effect or does it mean that it's immuned to the<br>
smolder effect including the other two minions?<br>
<br>
If I play Crushing Growth on my opponent's creature and manage to kill it<br>
forcing him to attack with all of his creatures next turn, on his next<br>
turn<br>
can he play shell and be immuned to the be forced to attack or will he<br>
have<br>
to attack?<br>
<br>
RT - When a Creature refers to itself by name within its text, unless it<br>
says "all of your Darkbreed's Minions" or something similar, it refers only<br>
to the copy of the Creature it is printed on. Each of your Darkbreed's<br>
Minions will Smolder the other two in play when you draw a card.<br>
<br>
It has been previously ruled that if a card tries to force a Creature to<br>
attack, and the Creature is immune to the effects of the card, the Creature<br>
will not have to attack. If the Shell makes the Creatures unaffectable by<br>
Crushing Growth, then they will not have to attack.<br>

<br>
Do you need creatures in the discard for Dream Rift to work? Or could you<br>
play it first turn and simply draw 3 cards? I think you need the<br>
creatures,<br>
but my opponent disagreed. So is it legal or no?<br>
<br>
RT - It is not required that there be Creatures in the discard pile for<br>
you to play Dream Rift, but just because there's nothing to shuffle into<br>
your deck does not mean you simply draw three cards. The deck is shuffled,<br>
then you draw three.<br>

3. If I'm using Voice of the Storm and I already played a Hurracane<br>
Orish. As we all know all my Arderial and Orothe creatures will cost<br>
me one less from now on (while the Orish is in play).<br>

But what about if I play a second Hurracane Orish, a Bubble Xyx<br>
or any other Orothe/Arderial Creature. Will that creature cost is<br>
reduce by 2 or 1?<br>
<br>
RT - All Orothe Creatures you play will have their cost reduced by one,<br>
and all Arderial Creatures you play will have their cost reduced by one,<br>
once the Hurricane Orish is played. The Bubble Xyx is an Arderial Creature<br>
(Cost -1), and an Orothe Creature (Cost -1), so it will cost two less to<br>
play.<br>

4. Yricho and Rayje's Belt<br>
I have Gar as my Magi and a Braggle and Granas in play. Yricho has a<br>
Rayje's Belt in play and locks down Strengthen. I morph my Braggle<br>
to Paradwyn, and then because of Athletic, Yricho locks down Mirror<br>
Shield. Since the Belt says it lasts until the end of "your" next<br>
turn, at the beginning of my opponents turn he also locks down<br>
Burrow. Besides this being completely obscene, how long is Mirror<br>
Shield locked down for? The essence of my question, is if Yricho<br>
uses a power out of turn, does it last until the end of my turn since<br>
it was used on my turn or until the end of his next turn like it is<br>
written on the card?<br>
<br>
Mydra Swarm and Drawing Cards<br>
If I cast a Mydra Swarm on my opponent: Can he play a Vellup or Elder<br>
Vellup to get a card from his draw deck? Can he steal one of my<br>
creatures and get a card from his discard pile from a Corathan? Can<br>
he attack me and have his Twee defeated to draw the top card of his<br>
discard pile? All three of these situations have the opponent<br>
drawing cards. I am fairly sure that the Mydra Swarm would not stop<br>
effects and powers like O'qua's conjure and Blygt's waking dreams<br>
because the cards are going from the deck or discard pile directly to<br>
play. What is the definition of drawing a card? If it is adding a<br>
card not in play to your hand, I would say the previous three should<br>
not work under a Mydra Swarm, hence my ruling question. The<br>
word "draw" ruling would be more rules lawyerish(read like M:tG), and<br>
drawing a card makes more logical sense since that is what it<br>
actually says. In summary, does it only stop cards that specifically<br>
have the word "draw" in them, or any card that lets you draw cards?<br>
<br>
Corathan and Crushing Darkness<br>
Does Betrayal only trigger when I gain control of an opposing card<br>
already in play, or whenever I gain control of an opposing card? If<br>
I cast a Crushing Darkness, can I get a card from my discard pile?<br>
<br>
Corathan and Recursion<br>
If I have a Corathan in play and cast Turn, can I get the Turn from<br>
my discard pile with Betrayal? My guess is no because the Spell is<br>
still resolving as the Effect Betrayal kicks in, so it is not<br>
actually in the discard pile yet. With the previous question,(if<br>
Crushing Darkness triggers Betrayal and it should) can I get the same<br>
Crushing Darkness back? If I have one already in the discard pile I<br>
can loop it for as much energy as I have(should be MRPed), but I just<br>
want to verify that I at least need 2 to pull this off. Also on the<br>
same line of thought if I use a River Abaquist to steal an opposing<br>
creature, can I get that same Abaquist back from Betrayal or do I<br>
need one already in the discard pile since Possess is still resolving?<br>
<br>
Stalking Burrow<br>
I have a 7 energy Bagala Hunter that attacks a Stalked 5 energy<br>
Pylofuf. Does the Pylofuf lose 3 or 2 energy? I figure since it is<br>
a Mechanic the answer is three.<br>
Would it matter if it was Gyrg's Pylofuf that was stalked/would it<br>
still lose three? Does the mechanic of "stalk" take precedent or<br>
Digging Mastery? In this situation it would seam that Digging master<br>
caps the total damage from all sources at 2 during each attack.<br>
<br>
Stalking Invulnerability<br>
Same question little twist. The 7 energy Bagala Hunter is attacking<br>
a 7 energy Rock Hyren. Does the Rock Hyren lose one from the<br>
stalking taking it down to 6, or does it stay at 7 since it has<br>
invulnerability? My guess is rock Hyren goes to 6, then the Bagala<br>
Hunter gains one to be at 8 from 'Hunt', and when the energy is<br>
resolved, the Hunter has 8 and the Hyren 6, so the hunter survives<br>
with 2 energy and the Rock Hyren has just enough damage to be<br>
discarded from play.<br>
<br>
RT - Answers below.<br>
<br>
Yricho and Rayje's Belt - "Until the end of your next turn." Lockdown,<br>
regardless of when you play it, gives the stipulation that it will end on<br>
the next turn of the Magi using it, not just the end of the next turn.<br>
Strengthen and Mirror Shield will become active again at the end of Yricho's<br>
next turn.<br>
<br>
Mydra Swarm and Drawing Cards - None of the Effects you referenced are<br>
card drawing, they are card retrieval. Just as Mydra Swarm cannot prevent<br>
the retrieval of starting cards, the ability to retrieve cards from the<br>
discard pile or deck is left intact.<br>
<br>
Corathan and Crushing Darkness - At no point after playing Crushing<br>
Darkness do you take control of another card. When you replay the Creature,<br>
with the exception that the owner of the card is still the owner, it is<br>
yours in its entirety. This means that, since no controllers were changed,<br>
Corathan's Effect is not triggered.<br>
<br>
Corathan and Recursion - The Turn will not be placed into the discard pile<br>
until after it has resolved; you will gain control of the Creature before<br>
Turn goes to the discard pile, and cannot retrieve it. However, a card such<br>
as Corrupt, which requires you to discard it, then resolve its effect, will<br>
be able to be retrieved by Betrayal.<br>
<br>
Stalking Burrow - Energy removed in by stalking happens during an attack,<br>
so it is counted in Gyrg's cap. Burrow will do nothing to prevent it, and so<br>
in your example the Pylofuf loses one energy from being stalked, then up to<br>
one more from the attack (thanks to Gyrg's cap).<br>
<br>
Stalking Invulnerability - The Hyren would be defeated. Stalking discards<br>
one energy from the Hyren, then when energy is discarded, the seven energy<br>
discarded by the Bagala Hunter is reduced to six by Invulnerability, then<br>
the Hyren's remaining six is discarded and it is defeated.<br>

5. Alright, basically I'm wondering what would happen if by chance your<br>
opponent plays a Tar Hyren after you've already played a Taglet and<br>
the following occurs.<br>
<br>
On your turn you use the Taglet's Power of Dream Cross to copy the<br>
Tar Hyren's Cling Effect. You then proceed to attack an opposing<br>
creature with energy greater than your Taglet. Does Taglet's Power<br>
allow it to use the copied Cling Effect on the creature it attacked?<br>
Remember the creature had a higher energy than the Taglet so the<br>
Taglet is defeated in the attack.<br>
<br>
RT - The Taglat will stay attached to the Creature and function just as<br>
the Tar Hyren would until the beginning of your next turn. Then, the Taglat<br>
will lose Cling and be a Creature card in play with zero energy, and be<br>
discarded immediately. Normally, the Cling allows it to be in play without<br>
energy once all the conditions of Cling are fulfilled, but once Cling is<br>
gone, there is nothing to hold it in play.<br>
<br>
Yes, this does mean that Locking Down Cling once a Tar Hyren is attached<br>
will discard the Tar Hyren from play. It would be a very sticky situation<br>
(no pun intended) if the Taglat were allowed to stay attached because it is<br>
still a Creature card and could be affected as such, meaning it could gain<br>
energy, etc. This is why Tar Hyren says "while attached, other cards cannot<br>
affect Tar Hyren".<br>

6. Let's say one of your creatures is affected by the Tar Hyren's Cling<br>

Moob Ring, thus preventing your magi from losing any energy from the<br>

RT - When you use Sorreah's Dream to copy a Power, the card with the Power<br>
does not pay the cost; the cost is in the cost of the Dream.<br>

You can only choose Creatures you control when copying Sanctuary, so you<br>
may not choose the opposing Hyren.<br>

8. I am guessing that because Grej and Prek were the first two magi who<br>
could play cards from eachothers region they were the forerunners of<br>
the dual region magi we have seen in the current expansion and were<br>
intended to play as such. Grej because she was raised as an orphan<br>
in the Underneath and Prek because... well, there really hasn't been<br>
much written with her in the stories that explore her relationship<br>
with Kazm.<br>
Anyway, my question is can we consider Grej and Prek to be dual<br>
region magi and play them as such? Was it 2I's intention that Greg<br>
and Prek be dual region before the actual dual region magi mechanic<br>
was released? I think that a ruling saying yes would be good because<br>
as they stand now, Grej and Prek can lose their ability to be dual<br>
region by someone locking down 'Kinship' with Rayje's Belt, facing<br>
an opponent using Sorreah, or getting hit by Crushing Heat. It seems<br>
especially unfair to Grej, who grew up in the Underneath and whose<br>
power only works with Underneath creatures. It also doesn't seem<br>
fair when you consider that Voice of Storms Orthea can't have her<br>
dual region aspect shut down and all she did was become ambasador to<br>
Arderial, as opposed to growing up there.<br>

creatures? I assume no, but again I'd like to be absolutely sure.<br>
And if he can't dream twist in anything, Nagisis should have picked<br>
his victim more wisely.<br>
<br>
RT - Dream Twist would have to say "play a Kybar's Teeth Creature<br>
regardless of region" to allow a corrupted Koll to play it. Unless the<br>
'regardless of region' clause is added to a Power, then its allowance of<br>
playing a card will not supercede the rules of the playing cards ruleset.<br>

Koll could play a Creature of the region referred to in Dream Twist, but<br>
his options would be limited to qualifying Creatures that could be played by<br>
Kybar's Teeth Shadow Magi.<br>

10. I guess I'm more referring to the two phrases (regarding move):<br>
"With a move/transfer effect, the card discards the amount from the target<br>
and also adds the amount to the receiving card, but both results are<br>
dependant on each other." (Rules Digest (Part 2) 05/03/02)<br>
&<br>
" 'Move' is shorthand for 'discard from one place, then add to another'.<br>
These values are not linked; increasing the amount of energy discarded as<br>
part of a 'move' (with Scroll of Fire, Intensify, Blast Gloves, or any<br>
similar Effect) does :not: increase the amount added." (Rules Digest<br>
05/17/02)<br>
<br>
When the two phrases are both talking about the same card and the same<br>
effect of the card, it seems to contradict itself. Thank you for your<br>
input. It helps me to see my questions trough someone else's eyes. I<br>
appreciate it.<br>
<br>
RT - Cards that reduce the energy discard of a move effect reduce the<br>
amount of energy added by the move effect; however, cards that increase the<br>
energy discard do not increase the energy added. This is the essence of what<br>
Steve and I were saying, but we ended up in a situation of "the right hand<br>
not realizing what the left hand is doing" when we phrased some of our<br>
previous answers.<br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
1. There has been recent concern over what exactly the reasoning is behind the rulings on move effects. Steve McLaughlin, Rules Team lead, will explain the mechanic, and why it works the way it does. <br>
<br>
Definition of 'Move' - Whenever a Spell, Power, or Effect requires you to move energy from one source to another, you discard the amount specified from the source that is being moved from, and add that same amount to the source that is being moved to. Cards that increase the energy discard do not increase the energy added, but cards that reduce the energy discarded do reduce the energy added by a corresponding amount. <br>
<br>
Explanation - This has been a 'concept' based idea from the beginning, and in he minds of the designers, the mechanic has never actually changed. Like the 'specific discard' concept, we were not even aware that there was confusion surrounding the 'move' idea until recently. <br>
Basically, think of 'move' in real-life terms. If I move a gallon of water from one bucket to another, it's obvious what happens. If I move a gallon less a cup, I don't have a whole gallon to add to the destination bucket. If I move a gallon plus a cup, I don't necessarily add the extra cup to the bucket (I might be thirsty).<br>
If there were effects that altered the amount of energy 'moved' by another card, they would affect both the amount to subtract from the source and the amount to add to the destination, regardless of whether it were a positive or negative change. Since there aren't, the above rules dictate how 'move' effects interact with energy loss increase/prevention.<br>

2. Effect - Overwrite: Whenever any player plays a Spell or uses a Power that<br>
specifies one or more regions, before any choices are made, you may discard <br>
two energy from your Magi. If you do, change one of the specified regions to <br>
a region of your choice. You may only use Overwrite once per Spell or <br>
Power, with Overwrite lasting until the end of the current turn. <br>
<br>
Does that mean that if you use Abwyn's Quill on say Forgotten Dancer to take <br>
control of a Pylofuf that you could not use Abwyn's Quill on Forgotten <br>
Dancer or any other Power named Excise for the rest of the game? <br>
<br>
For Example: You play Abwyn's Quill and Forgotten Dancer on your second <br>
turn. You use Forgotten Dancer, changing Core to Underneath(with the Quill) <br>
and taking control of Pylofuf. On your fourth turn you play a second <br>
Forgotten Dancer. Are you allowed to once again overwrite Core with <br>
Underneath to take control of another 'Neath creature? <br>
<br>
RT - "Once per Spell or Power" only means you can Overwrite one specific instance of the Spell or Power. This is to stop a Spell or Power from having multiple regions mentioned being Overwritten repeatedly; it does not mean that you cannot use Overwrite on the same Power later on in the game, or even play another Forgotten Dancer that turn and Overwrite the new one on the same turn. <br>

My Question is: At what point does my opponent have to declare whether <br>

the opportunity to adjust the Taglat's starting energy by up to +/-3. <br>

6. I was rummaging through some cards and I came across the spell, <br>
UPDRAFT. After reading it, since it's been awhile since I've seen one <br>
I was curious how this would work with AROSA'S SHELL GAME. If I was <br>
given control of a creature, on my turn, could I effectively UPDRAFT <br>
the creature(for exmaple: a bubble xyx) into my hand? Then regain my <br>
creature. <br>
<br>
Would this even work? <br>
<br>
And if it did when I replayed that creature would I have to give up <br>
control of it later on because of shell game? <br>
<br>
RT - Updraft returns the Creature to the OWNER'S hand. The owner is the person who started the game with the card in their deck. When you Updraft the Xyx, it will return to the opponent's hand. <br>
<br>
Additionally, there has been controversy over what would happen to one of Arosa's Creatures that was given to the opponent by Shell Game, then Arosa being defeated. The Creature would not leave play, nor would it stay with the controlling player indefinitely; it would return to Arosa's Player's side of the table when the duration for Shell Game ends, more than likely creating an orphan Creature, if only briefly. This orphan is NOT immune to opposing Spells, Powers, Effects, or attacks. <br>

7. I have come to assume that -Playing- a card means moving a card from <br>
your hand to the table. <br>
<br>
This question became manifest after I got my Orothe butt handed to me <br>
by the Magi card "Korg and Zet". It says they can only "Play" two <br>
cards per turn. Does this mean they can only put down two cards from <br>
their hand, Or does it mean Korg and Zet can only do a combination <br>
of; fielding new cards, attacking, using powers, so long as these <br>
actions do not exceed two <br>
<br>
RT - When you 'play' a card it means that you take it from an out of play area (hand, deck, or discard pile) and place it onto the playing field. Using a Power or Effect on a card is not considered 'playing' a card, generally, but if you have a limit or restriction on playing cards and you use a Power or Effect to try and exceed that limit, the part of the Power or Effect that puts the card into play will fizzle. Example: <br>
<br>
Hrada has used Tainted Touch on O'Qua, making her an Orothe Shadow Magi. She uses Conjure and searches her deck only to find a Giant Parathin. Because she can only play Orothe Creatures with Conjure, but cannot play normal Orothe Creatures because she is a Shadow Magi, she must ignore the Parathin and then shuffle the deck. <br>
<br>
Another, more specific example to the situation at hand: <br>
<br>
Korg & Zet play Entomb, naming Hyren's Call, then play Hyren's Call. Because they have reached their two cards per turn limit, they can only look through their deck and shuffle it before Zet scolds Korg for wasting their Spells. <br>

8. If I use Nagsis to corrupt Prek, can she still use her Kinship <br>
effect to play Kybars Teeth cards "ignoring regional penalties and <br>

Kybars Teeth magi as opposed to a Shadow Underneath magi. <br>
Also, does she still get Urhail as a starting card? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, because she specifically says "ignoring regional penalties and restrictions", she gets around the restriction of Core Magi to be unable to play non-Core cards; the same with Grej. As for Prek being able to retrieve an Urhail, Nagsis makes her a Shadow Magi immediately, before she retrieves starting cards, so she cannot retrieve an Urhail. <br>

<br>
I'm not really clear on how this works. Does a 4 energy Creature <br>
with "Dreamwarp" become playable as a 7 energy Creature? Thanks for <br>
your help. <br>
<br>
RT - No; Dazzle only applies to Creatures that are already in play with "Effect - Dreamwarp". This does not affect Creatures as they are played. <br>

1. Hmm, here's one I just ran across. If Yerthe has a<br>
Sand Hyren in play, since he has Starting: any one<br>
Hyren, can he play any hyren for two less due to Sand<br>
Hyren's Light Side effect?<br>
<br>
RT - Yerthe could play the cards "Any one Hyren" and "Staff of Hyren" for two<br>
less energy. Since there's no such thing as 'Any one Hyren' and Staff of <br>
Hyren already costs zero, Light Side is fairly useless for Yerthe.<br>

2. I'm putting together a new Core deck, and was wondering if Ruid's Mutate <br>
effect<br>
applies to itself when it's coming into play (and thus circumventing the<br>
regional restriction), or if it only applies to creatures that come into play<br>
after Ruid is already in play itself.<br>
<br>
RT - Ruid cannot mutate itself as it comes into play; Mutate becomes active <br>
once the Ruid actually enters play, which is after Mutate could trigger to <br>
change the Ruid.<br>

3. I'm not trying to argue here, but I thought the timing<br>
rules stated that one Effect would be processed by the<br>
current player, then one by his opponent and so on<br>
until one player didn't have Effects, at which case<br>
the player that still had Effects would choose the<br>
order desired.<br>
Was there a rule reversal I missed?<br>
<br>
RT - All effects that occur simultaneously are resolved in the order their <br>
controller chooses, beginning with all of the active player's effects, then <br>
all of the inactive player's (players') effects, in turn order. This is the <br>
way it has been since the issue was a concern (first introduced post <br>
Awakening, I believe). <br>

4. Okay, I have a Heppeswip in play as well as a Junjertrug. A friend <br>
playing Cald has only a Saladarit in play. On his turn he uses the <br>
Saladarit's power of "Guard" on itself. Of course my Junjetrug has to <br>
attack his Saladarit because of the effect "Rage", thus killing my <br>
Junjertug from the "Guard" power. So I used the Heppeswip's effect <br>
of "Unravel" to kill his Saladarit. Can I do this? It seems to me <br>
that the power did affect my Junjertrug (who was quite large by-the-<br>
way). After all, he had a bad case of dead when he should have ate <br>
the Saladarit for a snack. However, I can see my friends point in <br>
that his Sladarit did not 'directly' affect my Junjertrug. <br>
<br>
So which one of us is correct. I went through all the archived <br>
Heppeswip rulings. I saw the rulings on Heppeswip vs. a Rayje's belt, <br>
so I think I might lose this one. However, the Belt affects named <br>
powers and effects whereas this actually effects a creature. So I <br>
guess I just want to hear it from the horse's mouth. Can y'all clear <br>
this up?<br>
<br>
RT - Unlike Lockdown, Guard does directly affect the Creature it discards; <br>
you could Unravel the Saladarit in the situation above.<br>

5. If Cataclysm and Syphon Vortex (Move), were always meant to work as <br>
has been outlined in the most recent rulings, then why were <br>
completely contradictory rulings made in both cases (either on this <br>
group, or on magiduel.com)? Why did it clearly state on Magiduel <br>
that things like a Deep Wellisk are NOT protected from Cataclysm? Why <br>
were 3 different rulings for Syphon Vortex made last month? Why was <br>
a ruling made several months ago that X couldn't be changed? I am <br>
honestly very curious.<br>
<br>
RT - The previous members of the Rules Team had the ability to make rulings<br>
without discussing it amongst the other rules team members; this was not a <br>
problem 99% of the time, but there was a 1% were there were design vs. intent <br>
conflicts. A lot of cases were simply a matter of rulings without discussion <br>
amongst the rest of the team; this is no longer an issue.<br>
<br>
In regards to MagiDuel and its lack of updates...To spare a lot of <br>
unnecessary details, the site is privately owned but happens to have the <br>
Rules Team's backing as official. Because of this private ownership, we <br>
cannot update it directly; we're working on the situation, and the site owner <br>
is very cooperative, he just happens to not have had the opportunity to <br>
assist us in the matter lately. <br>
<br>
In the meantime, players should monitor the rules digests, as they take <br>
precedence over everything previously published. If there is any questionable <br>
conflict, we would like to be made aware, so that we can either correct the <br>
seeming problem or at least explain our stance on the matter. The Magi-Nation <br>
rules process is much more democratic than can be said for most other games, <br>
and we would like to keep it that way as much as we can; very rarely is the <br>
case that we have said "that's just the way it is". We value player input and <br>
are willing to at least listen to all sides of the argument.<br>

<br>
6. Alright, since the MRP on Sypon Vortex has it no longer <br>
saying "move", do the rules on "move" still apply to the card?<br>
<br>
If so, I suggest that you once again MRP Syphon Vortex, because as <br>
the card reads now, it is NOT apparent that you reduce X, but don't <br>
increase X. It is my belief that new players should be able to <br>
figure out cards by reading them, and not referring to this group, so <br>
SV should be MRP'd once more.<br>
<br>
RT - Syphon Vortex, as of its latest printing, says "move"; all rules for <br>
move apply. <br>

7. Had an unanticipated question come up Saturday regarding focus. How does <br>
focus handle the changes in energize rates by Channels, Collar of Despair, <br>
Water of Life etc? Will the change be trippled by the focus or does it get <br>
applied after the Magi's base energize rate is trippled?<br>
<br>
RT - If a card changes the Energize rate specifically, then it alters the <br>
amount added by Focus. In the case of a Dream Channel, if a Magi's base was <br>
five, then modified by the Channel to seven, then the Focus rate would be <br>
twenty-one. The Collar, five minus one to four, then tripled to twelve. And <br>
so on and so forth...<br>

8. If, say, a Dasia Dreamwarped for an additional energy, does that <br>
energy come from the Magi? And does it stay on the Dasia (Dreamwarp says<br>
until the end of your turn).<br>
<br>
And Burrow (and Gyrg's Effect Digging Mastery). If, say, a Urigant attacked <br>
my burrowed Pylofuf, would the Urigant lose only two energy, too? Say I had a <br>
Digging Goggles out and had Pylofuf attack the Urigant; would Pylofuf only <br>
lose two energy and the Urigant lose whatever amount of energy is on Pylofuf? <br>
Would Digging Mastery work the same as Burrow (except for the Spell/Power<br>
part)?<br>
<br>
RT - When a Creature Dreamwarps, it raises or lowers the starting energy of <br>
the Creature, and you pay the cost of playing the Creature normally. <br>
Additionally, since it is alright for a Creature to have more than its <br>
starting energy under normal circumstances, when the Creature's starting <br>
energy returns to normal, it keeps the extra from Dreamwarp.<br>
<br>
Urigant would discard its full energy from a Pylofuf in an attack, because of <br>
Dig Up. If the Urigant was Burrowed, it would lose only two energy, as long <br>
as there was not another Urigant in play.<br>
<br>
Digging Mastery is a bit different from Burrow...Besides not counting as <br>
being 'burrowed', meaning Dig Up doesn't affect it, unlike Burrow, it creates <br>
an absolute energy loss cap of two that applies to the entire attack, not <br>
just the energy removal portion of it. What does this mean? There are very <br>
few instances where this will mean anything different in an attack, but in <br>
the case of Stalking or Effects that discard energy during attacks, this does <br>
count against the two energy loss. If a Burrowed Creature was attacked while<br>
stalked, it would lose one energy from being stalked, then could lose two <br>
more from the attack, whereas a Digging Mastery protected Creature would lose <br>
one from being stalked, then could not lose more than one from the rest of <br>
the attack.<br>

10. A question has arisen with regard to Jip.<br>
Jip was nice and annoying to the Arderial players<br>
whenever they tried Xyx tricks, and worked well<br>
against follow Naroomers when Grows and Forest Hyrens<br>
hit the table, but there seems to be some disagreement<br>
with regard to Jip and interactions with the current<br>
Bograth Powers / Spells / and Relics.<br>
Bograth versus Naroom. Naroom player has Jip out. If<br>
Bograth player with 3 Bograth creatures out plays<br>
Frenzy, then the Jip gains 8, correct (2 for itself,<br>
and 2x3 for the cumulative energy gained by opposing<br>
creature{s} this turn). Or does Jip only gain 4?<br>
Same goes for the Bograth relic where you pay 2 to<br>
give 1 energy to each Bograth creature, if there are 5<br>
Bograth creatures, and Jip in play - Jip gains 5,<br>
correct? Or does Jip only gain 1?<br>
<br>
RT - The Jip would gain an amount of energy equal to ALL of the energy added <br>
by one ability (Power or Effect, or Spell) of a card to opposing Creatures. <br>
If a Spell, Power, or Effect adds two energy to five opposing Creatures, Jip <br>
would gain ten energy.<br>

11. Okay all, here are some things that have come up in the last two nights <br>
of warring over the Moonlands. Sorry there are a decent number, we take <br>
ample notes when we play because we play in and run a lot of convention <br>
games. Any RT clarification would help, especially with the League-trees of <br>
Naroom looming over us...<br>
<br>
A:<br>
Tar Hyren states that he is discarded if the creature is discarded, but that <br>
no cards can affect him. The rules state that when a Magi is defeated, all <br>
of his cards are discarded from play. When a Magi's Tar Hyren is attached to <br>
another player's creature, and the Tar-Hyren-Owning Magi is defeated, what <br>
happens? Does he stay in play (because he is only discarded when the critter <br>
he is stuck to goes) or does he vanish because the Magi keeping the tar in <br>
the Moonlands is gone (because he is a card belonging to that Magi)?<br>
<br>
B:<br>
Do multiple effects given by multiple copies of the same creature stack?<br>
i.e.. *Do your Bograth and Core creatures cost one less for EACH Swamp <br>
Hyren you have in play, or...<br>
*Do your Granite Parmalags give each Parmalag in play the equivalent of <br>
Invulnerability-1 for EACH GrPmlg (three GrPmlgs and one regular Parmalag <br>
makes the regular one lose three less in attacks), or...<br>
*For each Scarlettsong Hwit do your Paradwyn beasties deal one additional <br>
when they attack and one less when they get attacked?, etc.?<br>
<br>
C:<br>
In a multi-player game, things get a little weird when a card states 'X' <br>
effect ends at the end of "your opponent's turn." Here is an example of one <br>
such situation: There are four players (A, B, C & D; and their turns go in <br>
that order). Player A plays a Shell Game with Arosa on Player D. When do <br>
they trade the little monkeys back? At the end of Player B's turn? He is an <br>
opponent. Or does it collectively mean all opponents? That way it they <br>
would trade back at the end of Player D's turn.<br>
<br>
D:<br>
This may have been clarified already, but is "reduce" the same as discard? A <br>
friend Vim and Vigor'd another friends uber-pylofuf (20+) and we all went <br>
"Uh... so like, does she only get two or what?"<br>
<br>
E:<br>
Does ENERGIZE: 1 count as "gaining" one energy? My wife had a Jile in play<br>
with seventeen other Bograth slimeballs and I had a Jip. Do all creatures <br>
with ENERGIZE "gain" that energy, making Jip the cutest, killiest, greeniest, <br>
deadliest little Naroomese sod-bird?<br>
<br>
F:<br>
Okay, this involves Dual Regions, as does the one after this. I have the <br>
ever-loving Hrada, and my friend has Baa. I turn Baa into a shadow Magi who <br>
is allowed to play cards from (his or hers) original region with a regional <br>
penalty of one (two if Naroom). Baa then plays Gwaeg, a Core/Bograth Dream<br>
Creature. Does Baa have to pay the regional penalty on this? A couple of us <br>
said no because it is also a Core creature thereby eliminating the need to <br>
cross regions. Another person said that Hrada does not state that the Magi <br>
becomes Core, just that they are now a "Shadow Magi" who can still cast their <br>
own cards with a penalty; thereby making Gwaeg cost the extra one because it <br>
had to be cast as Bograth. I confused by the growing mire posed that though <br>
it was Core, it was still a Bograth card and though the "normal" rules state <br>
that a Core Magi could cast a Core creature without regional penalty, Hrada <br>
as a card (which overrules rules) is not really specific as to how it relates <br>
to "normal" Shadow Magi. We diced off and the one energy was not paid. (A <br>
ten minute discussion over one energy, but it was a fun dissection of the <br>
rules and not an argument... so what the heck, eh?) How does this work <br>
exactly? It may be simple but we are curious.<br>
<br>
G:<br>
It has been cleared up what you CAN do with dual region cards, but not so <br>
much with what you CAN'T. Here is what I mean... You can count a dual region <br>
card as one of each when a spell counts the number of X and Y creatures, and <br>
you can hurt a Weave/Naroom creature with something that hurts all Weave <br>
creatures... but we came across something that really asks the question "What <br>
CAN'T you do?"<br>
I have a Rayje's Band (Boots) in play. It states that Non-Universal Magi <br>
may not cast Non-Universal spells (creatures) that are not of their region. <br>
My opponent is using Amanax and tries to cast a Brushfire (Flame Rudwot). <br>
What happens? The book states that the cards are both regions equally, so <br>
while it is a Cald spell (creature) it gets by, but it is as equally a Weave <br>
spell (Naroom creature) and is thus prohibited by the Band (Boots). In <br>
situations like this, what takes precedence: what is allowed or what is <br>
denied? If you can think of other applications to the ruling besides this <br>
example, please let us all know... the Dual Region thing is such a convoluted <br>
subject amongst different "schools of player thought" that the most <br>
explanation possible can only help.<br>
<br>
RT - Answers below:<br>
<br>
A - The game rules for defeat would discard the Tar Hyren from play; it is <br>
not being affected by a card, but a game rule.<br>
<br>
B - All effects of those cards are cumulative; the only exception would be if <br>
a card received multiple energize rates. In that case, it would use the best <br>
one.<br>
<br>
C - In Shell Game's case "your opponent" refers to the controller of the <br>
Creature you gained control of.<br>
<br>
D - Reduce means to reduce. The Pylofuf would lose two energy if Burrow were <br>
in effect, and the Magi would gain two.<br>
<br>
E - When a card energizes, it isn't "gaining energy" as far as the rules are <br>
concerned; Jip would gain nothing.<br>
<br>
F - Because Hrada does not say "with an increased cost of one" but "with a <br>
regional penalty of one", then this means that if the card is out of region <br>
for that Magi, then, yes, they will pay an additional regional penalty of <br>
one. A Bograth/Core card is not out of region for a Bograth Shadow Magi. <br>
Another issue with Hrada, if he taints a Naroom Magi and the Naroom Shadow <br>
Magi tries to play a Naroom Creature that Naroom Shadow Magi could play, they <br>
would still pay the full regional penalty of two.<br>
<br>
G - In the cases of dual-region cards, they are equally both regions at the <br>
same time. Amanax would be able to play the Brushfire since it's Cald, just <br>
as Kesia can play Brushfire since it's Weave. <br>

12. You know, we never did get much clarification on what exactly is <br>
meant by creature type. It was never really an issue before Sarzan <br>
Outcast and Scyalla. Personally, I think Scyalla makes it pretty <br>
clear with her example of "two different xyxes" as to what is meant <br>
by creature type. Saying "Balder" would let her play Balder, Giant <br>
Balder, and Ballistic Balder. Naming "Orish" would let her play <br>
Orish, Hurricane Orish, and Firestorm Orish. <br>
But players argue that it's different with Sarazen Outcast. <br>
Is it possible to name "giant" as a creature type with Sarazen <br>
Outcast's so that it can get it's favored enemy/bane bonus agains't <br>
Giant Balder, Giant Carillion, Giant Arboll, Giant Parathin, etc.? <br>
Or can Sarazen Outcast name "Magma" as a creature type and get the <br>
favored enemy/bane bonus against Magma Hyren, Magma Jile, and Magma <br>
Parmalag? <br>
<br>
RT - Any single word in a Creature name is a Creature type; this applies to <br>
any part of speech, not just nouns. Giant could be named, or Magma, or <br>
Baldar, or Orish...Etc. You could even say "Ballistic" and affect only <br>
Ballistic Baldars. <br>

Treavor Perry asks again:<br>
<br>
14. A)Please, rules team, define regional restriction.<br>
<br>
B)If Ulk cleansed crushing darkness, and then played one, as we all <br>
know she now can, can she still play the defeated creature, because <br>
crushing darkness states that the creature is played as a core <br>
creature. Underneath magi cannot play core creatures without <br>
explicit text from the card. What's going on?<br>
<br>
C)I disagree with rulings made previously about crushing spells and <br>
cards that allow you to ignore regional penalties and restrictions, <br>
such as Heart of the Sky, Hand, and Tomes of the GL. I personally <br>
feel that the sentence "Only Underneath Magi and Underneath Shadow <br>
Magi can play Crushing Fungus." is a regional restriction. <br>
Therefore, with Heart of the Sky, I would be able to play it, even <br>
though my magi is Arderial, because I ignore regional restrictions. <br>
If this is not a regional restriction, than what is it? <br>
<br>
RT - Answers below:<br>
<br>
A - A regional restriction means that your Magi is forbidden from playing <br>
cards of a certain type of a certain region because the Magi's region is <br>
different from the card to be played. The inability for Core Magi to play <br>
non-Core, non-Universal cards, as well as the inability for non-core Magi to <br>
play Core cards or non-Universal Relics not of their region, are regional <br>
restrictions.<br>
<br>
B - If the Magi could not play a Core Creature, then they would be unable to <br>
follow through with the second half of Crushing Darkness, and would get no <br>
Creature back. Exceptions would be if the Creature had the text "Underneath <br>
Magi may play xxxx", in the example you gave, or the corresponding region for <br>
your Magi.<br>
<br>
C - It's not a regional restriction within the definition of the rules, it is <br>
a specific restriction on the card regarding who can play it.<br>

<br>
RT - Against Shell, it works similarly as against Shadow Cloak; all energy<br>
discard of non-Orothe Spells and Powers gets through. Entangle is different,<br>
however, because you cannot even attempt to play a Spell that would discard<br>
energy, so that Sword wouldn't "know" energy removal is being reduced, in a<br>
manner of speaking. Against Tranquility, energy is still discarded normally;<br>
all Tranquility does in this case is net a card draw.<br>
<br>
B. does piercing allow creatures or relics that normally couldn't be<br>
discarded to be discarded (such as relic stalker taking out gift of<br>
the weave)<br>
<br>
RT - No; "discard" is a completely different mechanic from "energy removal".<br>
<br>
C. could you clarify whether weave hut can stop a creature like the<br>
zungg from moving energy from my creatures. my opponent argued that<br>
the energy wasn't "discarded" but rather moved so the weave hut<br>
didn't apply.<br>
<br>
RT - Move is a "discard X to add X" effect. The energy removal of Gnaw would<br>
be prevented, and the Zungg would receive nothing.<br>

3. Nyrex vs Cataclysm - Since the controller chooses the order of<br>
discard, you are allowed to place all of your other weave / Paradywn<br>
creatures under Nyrex, and then immediately 'release' one, yes?<br>
<br>
Nyrex vs Tidal Wave - This should be the same scenario.. Nyrex + some<br>
other creature has been discarded via' a Tidal Wave. The Nyrex should<br>
be able to catch, and then release it's buddy, once it itself has<br>
been discarded, right?<br>
<br>
RT - The problem with this case is, though both effects are triggered<br>
simultaneously, they both cannot actually be processed fully. The Nyrex will<br>
be able to release anything it currently "holds", but when it tries to Catch<br>
anything else, there will be no Nyrex there to hold the Creatures, so<br>
'Catch' will fizzle.<br>

4. I was wondering, Rayje's Cloak says that Opposing cards do not prevent<br>
your<br>
cards from using their powers and effects. Would that prevent Sorreach from<br>
supressing my Magi's powers and effects? When it says "opposing cards" does<br>
that count for magi? Or would that just count for non-magi cards?<br>
<br>

your Magi.<br>

5. Saladrit's Guard says "Choose any one Cald or Orothe Creature in play.<br>
Until the beginning of your next turn, the first time the chosen Creature is<br>
attacked, discard the attacking Creature from play before energy is<br>
removed."<br>
<br>
Heppeswip's Unravel says "Whenever an opposing Creature or Relic uses a<br>
power that affects one or more of your other Weave Creatures in play, you<br>
may discard one energy from Heppeswip to discard the opposing Creature or<br>
Relic from play."<br>
<br>
My comment: Guard does clearly affect the first creature that attacks it, as<br>
you say. However, it does not affect that creature when the power is used.<br>
Unravel's text seems to imply that the power must be affecting the creature<br>
at the time the power is used. Am I reading too much into the phrasing?<br>
<br>
RT - The intent in situations like these are to apply when the effect of the<br>
card actually "hits" the victim in question; this is similar to playing a<br>
Furok after an opponent has used Deadfall. Fird Favor will still trigger and<br>
let you reduce the energy loss, though the Spell is long gone. In your<br>
example, you may use Unravel to discard the Saladrit at the time of the<br>
attack.<br>

<br>
Can you play Ambush with the crown on a Magi?? They both have<br>
starting energy. It would be pretty good if you could but it sounds<br>
too go to be true.<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; the term 'starting energy' is universal to Magi and Creatures.<br>
<br>
and has the Crown been errataed so that "if any card is discarded from<br>
ypur hand by an opposing card, you may discard Abraxin's crown<br>
instead...etc" been givin the effect word before it like Climbing<br>
Staff.. or is it just there with no distinction??<br>
<br>
RT - It is not an Effect; merely card text. If it were an Effect, discard<br>
could use it to their advantage, by discard their own Crown when you use one<br>
against them, making you lose you hand, your energy, and sealing the lock.<br>

8. I know I'm just starting this but I ran into a problem in one of my<br>
games. It was with The "Curse of the Abaquist" card and "Umm...no".<br>
<br>
Player A plays: "Curse of the Abaquiat"<br>
-Choose any one of your Orothe or paradwyn creatures in play.<br>
Until the end of the turn, the choosen creature gains the<br>
text: "Power-possess: Choose anyone opposing creature in play with<br>
less engery than this creature. //Discard//this creature from play,<br>
gain control of the choosen creature. That creature cannot attack<br>
this turn.<br>
<br>
Player B wants to play: "Ummm...no!"<br>
- Play "umm..No!" only when an opponent plays a spell that<br>
specifically discards one of your creatures from play. You may<br>
play "umm...No!" during your opponents turn.<br>
<br>
There was a samll dispute about if it would work. Can anyone give<br>
advise? I know one arguement is that The "Curse of the Abaquiat" only<br>
gives a power to a creature. against this is that this spell specfic<br>
discards a creature none the less. I really don't know how to rule<br>
this. I also know that this ruleing would effect things like certain<br>
creatures that have the effect only aderial spells can effect them,<br>
would "Curse of Abaquiat" work on them.<br>

RT - Um...NO! only protects your Creatures, meaning only the Creatures you<br>
control. The Um...NO! could not be played.<br>

9. This past weekend, another Director told me of a<br>
ruling I had not seen. Can you confirm?<br>
<br>
Corrupt - Is there an MRP stating that if the casting<br>
Magi is defeated, the Corrupt fizzles even if the<br>
opposing Magi was selected when the Corrupt was cast?<br>
<br>
RT - All cards controlled by a Magi are discarded from play when that Magi<br>
is defeated. If the Corrupt has not been triggered, it's lost.<br>
<br>
Focus - What defines "playing no cards" in the next<br>
turn? I would assume that no relics may be put into<br>
play, no spells may be cast, and no creatures may be<br>
summoned -- but does that also mean that no Powers<br>
and/or Effects on cards already in play may not be<br>
utilized (one player even took it to the extreme that<br>
no non-Magi card may energize either - i.e. Rabbage or<br>
Monarch Hyren).<br>
<br>
RT - Playing a card, by definition, is moving a card from an out of play<br>
area (hand, deck, or discard pile) onto the playing field. Cards already in<br>
play can do whatever you please, but if they try to play anything<br>
themselves, the actual 'play' effect fizzles.<br>

<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Warrada (thesadow@...)<br>
<br>
11. Here's some things I've been wondering about:<br>
<br>
A. The Dark Twins starting cards list "Any Core Creature". Does this<br>
mean<br>
the creature card selected must specifically say "Core Dream Creature" on<br>
it, or<br>
can a card like Swamp Hyren that specifically states "Core Magi can play<br>
[insert<br>
creature name here]" be chosen instead?<br>
<br>
RT - It must specifically say "Core" and "Dream Creature" in its card type.<br>
This means no Swamp Hyren.<br>
<br>
B. Can the effect on Warrada's Ring be used the turn it's put into play,<br>
or do<br>
you have to wait until your following turn to use it?<br>
<br>
RT - Phenomenal Cosmic Power triggers at the beginning of your turn; this<br>
means that it will have to last a turn to be used.<br>
<br>
C. If you're playing a Core deck, and have a Swamp Hyren and a Glablit in<br>
play<br>
(after playing a Gwaeg or something), would all subsequent Bograth and Core<br>
creature cards cost two less energy?<br>
<br>
RT - No; Swamp hyren has a single cost reduction ability that applies to<br>
both Core and Bograth Creatures. Therefore, any creature that satisfies the<br>
condition would cost one less energy. In contrast, Voice of the Storm's<br>
Diplomacy Effect has two separate cost reduction effects in it, each with<br>
separate conditions. If both conditions are met, both reductions apply. In<br>
addition, Glablit only affects your Creature in play, not ones in the<br>
process of being played.<br>
<br>
D. Following the train of thought from the last question, would each of<br>
your<br>
Bograth and Core creatures in play gain two energy from a Blight spell if<br>
you<br>
had a Glablit in play?<br>
<br>
RT - Again, Blight has a single effect of adding energy to Creatures that<br>
fit either of the conditions listed. So, any Creature that fits either (or<br>
both) condition, will receive one energy. Creatures that fit both conditions<br>
would not receive two energy however, since any Creature only gets energy<br>
from Blight once.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
SSJ_Mato asks again:<br>
<br>
12. Ullig, one of the coolest most awsome fearless Kybars Teeth magi<br>
ever, has no creatures in play so spends 2 precious energy to<br>
activate Kybars Fang and make it into a creature and squish a puny<br>
Orok. Because of Orok's nasty effect Ullig has no energy left on<br>
her.<br>
My question: When Kybars Fang the Creature becomes the Kybars Fang<br>
the Relic again does Ullig get four energy (still not enough I<br>
think) from Fearless or is she defeated?<br>
<br>
RT - Ullig gains the energy when her last Creature is actually discarded<br>
from play; the Fang never is, and she would gain nothing. If she has no<br>
other energy in play, she is defeated.<br>
<br>

13. Ok, this has been bugging us for a while and we needed this answered<br>
before our tournaments come up.<br>
<br>
A) Entangle says to choose a Magi. That Magi cannot play spells on<br>
his/her next turn (general). But the Mantle of Shadows says you may<br>
play Core spells with a regional penalty of 1 (specific, since it<br>
only says core.) Now, does this mean that if I drop a Mantle/have one<br>
in play I can play Core spells through an entangle? How does this<br>
relate to the general vs. specificity ruling if you cannot?<br>
<br>
RT - You cannot; the Mantle does specifically grant the Magi the ability to<br>
play Core Spells, but this is assuming the Magi may already play Spells. The<br>
Entangle removes that ability altogether.<br>
<br>
B) What about other cards like Hand/Heart of the Sky, Tomes of the<br>
Great Library, etc? These all specifically say you can play a spell.<br>
Would these get around the entangle?<br>
<br>
RT - Again, no; while Entangle is in effect, the ability to play Spells in<br>
any manner is removed from the Magi.<br>
<br>
C) Even more complicated: What about Evil Evu/Sorrowing Ogar/Shadow<br>
cards (ie. Core Grag/Deadfall). Can they play spells through an<br>
Entangle? Deadfall says "Naroom Shadow Magi may play Deadfall." Isn't<br>
that specific enough?<br>
<br>
RT - They must have the ability to play Spells, which Entangle removes.<br>
<br>
D) Now, taking Entangle vs. Mantle of Shadows to another level, what<br>
about Focus? Focus says "you cannot play cards until the end of your<br>
next turn." Very general. Does O'Qua get around this with Conjure,<br>
since it specifically says you can only play an Orothe creature from<br>
your deck w/ 4e? What about Evil Evu and Naroom cards? Warlum and<br>
Materialize?<br>
<br>
RT - No, you still cannot play cards in any way; this means that all<br>
"summon" effects fizzle and do not get to play what they had summoned; the<br>
card stays in its out of play area (hand, deck, or discard pile).<br>
<br>
E) Nalo and Lava Flow are specifically worded so there is nothing<br>
that can stoop them. Neither Entangle nor Focus are worded like this.<br>
Theoretically, this means you should be able to use a Tomes/Evil<br>
Evu/Shadow card/O'Qua/Mantle/etc to get around things like<br>
Entangle/Focus. Right? I mean, what would make these situations any<br>
different from Hrada and the Boots/Band?<br>
<br>
RT - Because Entangle changes the rules and completely removes the ability<br>
to play Spell cards.<br>
<br>
Going back and looking at the cards again, you are absolutely right.<br>
Tranquility stops the Spells that would remove energy from being played in<br>
the first place, so there's no energy loss prevention to negate with Rayje's<br>
Sword.<br>

Thanks for the double-check, and sorry about the confusion.<br>

How is Tranquility any different that entangle? It<br>
makes certain spells and powers umplayable which I<br>
have alway interpreted as meaning a player can't even<br>
declare them. Just like a player can't declare they<br>
are playing a spell under Entangle they can't declare<br>
they are using a spell, power or effect that would<br>
remove energy under tranquility. Tranquility, the way<br>
the card reads, should prevent the declaration of an<br>
action not prevent the damage done.<br>
<br>
Third time's the charm, I guess... I knew that the reversal didn't sit right<br>
with me for some reason. in the Cald/Arderial Demo decks, Tranquility was<br>
MRPed for clarity. the text on that version reads:<br>
<br>
Until the beginning of your next turn, all Spells that discard Energy<br>
instead discard no energy. Draw one additional card during your Draw Step.<br>
<br>
By this wording, Tranquility is obviously reducing energy loss, and Rayje's<br>
Sword pierces right through that. The original answer to the question on the<br>
Rules Digest stands.<br>

1. To my knowledge, you can dreamwarp a<br>
3 energy creature in at 2 energy, and at the end of your turn, it goes back<br>
to 3 energy, correct? Likewise, if you dreamwarped the same creature in at<br>
4,<br>
it would go to 3 at the end of the turn. I wanna make sure as my friend<br>
disagrees, saying it doesn't make sense for a creature to 'gain' energy at<br>
the end of the turn if it dreamwarped in at less than its starting.<br>
<br>
RT - A Creature can have less or more energy than its printed starting<br>
energy amount. When you Dreamwarp a Creature and its starting energy returns<br>
to normal at the end of the turn, it does not change the Creature's current<br>
energy; you get what you paid for.<br>

RT - When a card is discarded from play, it goes to its Owner's discard pile<br>
after all of the Effects that are triggewred by the Creature's discard are<br>
resolved. Your opponent (who controlled the Twee when it was discarded) will<br>
get the Creature from his discard, and the Twee will go to your discard<br>

Trevor Perry (boysavant@...) writes:<br>
<br>
3 - First off, I still say someone at II needs to write the "definitive"<br>
guide to dreamwarping and other game "status" such as burrow, stalk,<br>
etc., and that people with questions about them search for them<br>
before starting a new thread.<br>
<br>
RT - Well, actually, Dreamwarp isn't a "status condition"; burrow, stalked,<br>
and now illusionary are it. Definitions of the statuses follow:<br>
<br>
Burrow: A Creature with the 'burrowed' status is affected in two ways:<br>
<br>
A - The Creature cannot attack.<br>
B - The Creature can only lose two energyu per turn to Spells, Powers, and<br>
attacks. Any further energy loss is prevented.<br>
<br>
All affects of Burrow are granted by the card text that granted Burrow; if<br>
it was granted by a Spell, Power, or Effect, then the energy loss reduction<br>
and inability to attack are tied to the Spell, Power, or Effect. If a<br>
continuous Effect grants Burrow, and the Effect cannot be used, then the<br>
Creature is no longer burrowed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Stalked: A Creature with the 'stalked' status is affected thusly:<br>
<br>
A - Whenever this Creature is attacked, before energy is removed, it loses<br>
one energy from the Creature attacking it.<br>
<br>
The energy discarded by being Stalked happens because attacking a Stalked<br>
Creature adds an extra step to the attack process. These are the steps of<br>
attacking a Stalked Creature.<br>
<br>
The energy loss happens after 'before energy is removed' Effects, but before<br>
the energy is removed. Also, energy discard by Stalking is not caused by an<br>
attack, Spell, Power, or Effect. If there are card effects that can reduce<br>
energy loss 'during an attack' , they will apply to the energy discarded by<br>
being Stalked, whereas card effects that limit energy discarded 'by attacks'<br>
ignore Stalking. (Basically, Gyrg can count Stalking loss in his 'two<br>
energy' cap, while being Burrowed can't.)<br>
<br>
This is also, honestly, fairly unprecedented; it creates energy removal that<br>
is not by a Spell, Power, Effect, attack, or even card text. But, it is also<br>
a unique status effect, and therefore simply has its own rules. The energy<br>
removal is tied to the attacking Creature for the sake of Effects like<br>
Bwill's Karma; if you Stalk a Bwill to defeat, you still lose the attacker.<br>
<br>
<br>
Illusionary: A Creature with the 'illusionary' status is affected in two<br>
ways:<br>
<br>
A - The Creature is treated as having zero energy as far as counting whether<br>
or not your Magi has energy in play to see if they are defeated.<br>
B - Illusionary Creatures cannot declare Magi as the defender when<br>
attacking.<br>
<br>
The illusionary status is conferred by the Spell, Power, or Effect that<br>
grants it; once a Creature becomes illusionary, however, it cannot lose that<br>
condition, unless a card specifically removes it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, as for Dreamwarp, Dreamwarp is a mandatory Effect. Whenever you play a<br>
Creature with Dreamwarp, unless Dreamwarp has been Locked Down, you must use<br>
it, though you may Dreamwarp for zero. If you choose a number other than<br>
zero, then the cost and starting energy of the Creature played is adjusted<br>
by the same amount, until the end of the turn. At the end of the turn, the<br>
adjusted starting energy of the Creature returns to the printed amount; this<br>
does not affect the Creature's current energy.<br>

4 - Question came up re: Piercing and legal targets.<br>
A) Relic-The Last Words: All Powers on your Cald and Orothe Creatures<br>

energy. Your Spells, Powers, and Effects can not discard energy from<br>
Opposing Magi.<br>
<br>
B) Creature-Flame Trulb Power-Fireball(1) Choos any one Creature in<br>

C) Spell- Brushfire: Choose any one Creature in play. Discard two<br>

<br>
Piercing: Spells, Powers, and Effects do not reduce energy loss.<br>
<br>
Sword with A -Does Piercing allow the player to discard energy from a<br>
magi if the magi was the chosen target?<br>
Sword with B and C -Does Piercing allow a player to target discard<br>
energy from a Magi even though the power/spell only allows Creatures<br>
to be targetted?<br>
<br>
Now to add to the mix: Abraxims Crown-Effect-Dreamburn: All of your<br>
Powers and Spells that discard energy from a single Creature or Magi<br>
may instead discard energy from either a single Magi or Creature.<br>
<br>
Noting the crown allows you to target both Creatures and Magi. We<br>
take the Crown, combine it with The Last Words, and throw piercing on<br>
top. Cast Brushfire. Now is the Magi a legal target? And does the<br>
Magi take full damage?<br>
<br>
RT - Alright, normally I'd be answering questions inline, but there's a<br>
sweeping answer here:<br>
<br>
Without the Crown in play, unless the card already says you can choose a<br>
Magi or a Creature, Piercing does not grant the ability to choose a Creature<br>
or Magi respectively, if you couldn't already.<br>
<br>
The Last Words prevent you from burning Magi at all; it prevents you from<br>
assigning energy loss to opposing Magi altogether. This is different from<br>
the Lovian/Lava Flow situation in that Lovian is assigned energy loss and<br>
then prevents it, where The Last Words eliminate opposing Magi as a choice<br>
when looking for things to burn.<br>

5 - Here is a quick question, I have been agruing with my friend about.<br>
<br>
Tomes of the Great Library is a duel region card, Core/Naroom, my<br>
friend is saying that a Naroom magi can't play Tomes of the Great<br>
Library because it is Core and the rulebook states, 'Magi from<br>
regions other than the Core cannot play any Core cards unless the<br>
card's text specifically says that they can.' But, I am saying that<br>
Naroom magi can play Tomes of the Great Library because it is Naroom<br>
as well. So, the question is, can non-core magi play the duel region<br>
core cards?<br>
<br>
RT - We actually forgot to put the reminder text on this one. The rules on<br>
regional restrictions and penalties regarding what Magi can play relevant to<br>
this question can be summed up with this:<br>
<br>
Magi can play cards of their region ignoring regional restrictions and<br>
penalties.<br>
<br>
What defines a Magi's region(s)? In the small box beneath the Magi's name,<br>
any region named (to the left of the dash if it has one) is the Magi's<br>
region(s). (We use this broad definition namely because of Togoth). The only<br>
exception to this rule are Shadow Magi, they are Core Magi that can play a<br>
few extra cards, but Shadow Magi in future sets will be changed to reflect<br>
this rule.<br>
<br>
What defines a non-Magi card's region(s)? Same criteria: any singular<br>
regional name to the left of the dash (if any) is the region(s) the card<br>
belongs to.<br>
<br>
So, when playing a card, the quickest way to determine whether or not your<br>
Magi can play it is to compare the regions of the Magi against the regions<br>
of the card; if there's at least one match, your Magi can play that card<br>
ignoring regional restrictions and penalties. In your example, you have a<br>
Magi that is Naroom, trying to play a card that is both Naroom and Core.<br>
When you make the comparison, since your Magi's region (Naroom) matches at<br>
least one region of the card (again, Naroom), the Magi can play it freely.<br>

6 - Question 1:<br>
As we all know Flame Rudwot can't use it's burning branches on Naroom<br>
and Cald creatures. Since Abraxin's Crown let me use the Flame Rudwot<br>
power on Magi, I was wondering if this power would affect a<br>
Cald or Naroom Magi?<br>
<br>
RT - Dreamburn replaces the word "Creature" with "Magi" in cases like this;<br>
you would still be restricted to non-Cald, non-Naroom Magi.<br>
<br>
Also Tryn Flame Saver will not have to much trouble with this since<br>
she can use Energy Substitution with Healing Flame, to remove energy<br>
from a Narrom or Cald creature or Magi with Crown, right?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Dreamburn would allow Healing Flame to affect Cald or Naroom Magi,<br>
then Energy Substitution changes "add" to "discard".<br>
<br>
Question 2<br>
I have Tryn Flame Saver, a Tap Roots in my hand and Abraxin's Crown<br>
in play. My opponent have a creature with 2 energy and his magi with<br>
1 energy.<br>
<br>
Since I can use Energy Substitution to remove 2 energy from 2<br>
creatures with Tap Roots, Can I use one of those energy removing to<br>
use it on my opponents Magi?<br>
<br>
RT - No; Dreamburn only applies to the very first line on Tap Roots, that<br>
lets you choose two Creatures; if you Dreamburned it to Magi, you would have<br>
to choose two Magi. You could still use Energy Substitution to discard two<br>
energy from both Magi, however, or two Creatures.<br>
<br>
Tap Roots questions:<br>
In Magiduel says that I can remove 0 energy from 1 creature and add 2<br>
to other. But in other to play that spell there should be at least two<br>
creatures, right?<br>
<br>
RT - There have to be at least two Creatures in play to use Tap Roots, and,<br>
yes, the amount of energy added and discarded is independent of each other.<br>
Finally, "up to" does encompass zero. If there's nothing but opposing<br>
Creatures in play, you may choose two of them, discard two from one, and add<br>
zero to another. This does give Tap Roots a very high level of flexibility<br>
that similar cards that simply move energy would not have.<br>
<br>
With the Abraxin's Crown a Tap Roots can target the same creature or<br>
Magi twice? Because in case that Tryn Flame Saver use it it could<br>
remove a total of 4 energy.<br>
<br>
RT - No; you still have to choose two different Creatures or Magi with the<br>
Crown in play.<br>
<br>
Also if Scroll of Fire is in play Tap Roots will remove 3 energy from<br>
2 creatures with Tryn Flame Saver, right?<br>
<br>
RT - If you used her Naroom Energy Substitution, then, yes.<br>

7 - I had a question about a few abilies, one of which was Balistic Baldar's<br>
effect. When B. Baldar says "Roll a die and choose any creatures up to that<br>
amount, discard three energy from each creature." and I roll a 4, but my<br>
opponent only has two creatures in play; do I have to choose two of my own<br>
to take the damage?<br>
<br>
RT - Actually, Ballistic Baldar says "equal to" not "up to"; because of<br>
this, if you roll a number higher than the number of Creatures the opponent<br>
has, you have to choose your own Creatures (Ballistic Baldar would be a good<br>
choice since it's probably not faring too well anyway). If you roll a number<br>
higher than the total number of Creatures in play, because there are no<br>
'escape clauses' such as "if you roll higher than the number of Creatures in<br>
play, Ballistic Baldar discards three energy from each Creature in play<br>
instead", you cannot finish resolving the Effect, and so it fizzles,<br>
discarding nothing else.<br>
<br>
Similar to the above, if I use stone storm which says: "Choose 2 creatures<br>
and discard X energy from each of them" when my opponent only has 1 creature<br>
in play; do I have choose one of mine?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; whenever a card says "choose Y Creatures", where Y is any number,<br>
it is implied that you have to choose that many different Creatures, unless<br>
the rest of the card effect states otherwise (such as Makoor). This means<br>
that cards like Swamp Weebo have a good chance of backfiring on you if try<br>
to rely on them.<br>

Power, as long as you had at least one other Creature in play, you would get<br>
the extra card. Unlike with the comparison's Kybar's Teeth cards usually<br>

3. Trygar and Sorreah/Rayje's Belt<br>
if trygar is defeated simultanenously when an opponent is using sorreah or<br>
locking him down w/ the belt, would his avenger effect still trigger since<br>
the effects of those cards would be cancelled due to being discarded, or<br>
would he still be handicapped?<br>
<br>
RT - By the time the effect that prevents him from using Avenger leaves<br>
play, he will have left play also, if his defeat and the removing of the<br>
effect was simultaneous. Note that in cases where he defeats himself by<br>
playing a Spell, etc., and the Spell removes the preventative effect, then<br>
he is defeated by having no energy, he would get to use Avenger.<br>
<br>
For instance, if Trygar had two energy left and an opposing Rayje's Belt was<br>
Locking Down Avenger, he could spend his remaining energy to play Resonate,<br>
choosing to discard the Belt. When Resonate resolved, the Belt would be<br>
discarded. Then, immediately afterward, since there are no pending card<br>
effects and there is a Magi with no energy in play (Trygar), he will be<br>
defeated. In the momentary pause between the Belt leaving play and the rules<br>
realizing Trygar was defeated, he would have regained the ability to use<br>
Avenger.<br>

attack; the same thing happens if you defeat an opposing Magi before your<br>

around (and you have to have something to attack, you can't just declare<br>

similar question) has probably been answered before but here it is<br>
anyways...<br>
<br>
If player A casts Entange on player B, I know that player B can immediately<br>
use the Staff to cancel out Entagle, but what if player B waits until his<br>
own turn? Can he then use the Staff to cancel out Entangle since it's still<br>
affecting him (kinda like how Sorreah always affects the opposing Magi and<br>
the staff can be used at any time to cancel his effect)? If this scenario<br>
does work, then can we assume that the Staff can cancel out any Spell,<br>
Power, or Effect that affects your Magi or hand weather the opposing card is<br>
in play or not?<br>
<br>
RT - At any time you could legally use an Effect during the duration of<br>
Entangle, you could discard the Staff to stop it, in case you wanted to wait<br>
until your turn to decide whether or not you needed to use Spells, etc.<br>

14 - A. With spells like Resonate, that have multiple, unrelated effects,<br>
what order do you process those effects in? Or once they are all decided<br>
on, do they all happen simultaneously?<br>
<br>
i.e. My friend has a Dasia in play, with one energy. Her Magi also only has<br>
one energy. I cast Resonate, choosing to remove energy from her Magi and<br>
her Creature. Dasia has an ability that gives it an equal amount of energy<br>
to that which is discarded from your Magi by opposing cards. So, if I<br>
remove the one from Dasia and the one from her Magi, what happens? The<br>
spell would discard Dasia, but does its Effect keep it around long enough to<br>
get the one from the Magi's discarded energy?<br>
<br>
RT - All results would be applied simultaneously; in the example you stated,<br>
the following would happen:<br>
<br>
a. Resonate will discard one energy from Dasia and two energy from the Magi<br>
simultaneously.<br>
b. Dasia's Effect is triggered by the energy discard, and so now the Magi<br>
will gain one energy, since the Magi is not defeated until all pending card<br>
effects are resolved.<br>
c. The Magi survives with one energy.<br>
<br>
The end result would be the same if the Magi had only one energy; though the<br>
energy discard is simultaneous, the energy add is immediately after the<br>
discard, so the one energy wouldn't go to the Magi in the middle of it<br>
losing two, but afterward.<br>
<br>
B. It has been ruled that you can Bloom twice to one opposing<br>
Spell/Power/Relic, but there is something we are wondering. If I have only<br>
one creature in play with a usable power, and I have two Blooms in my hand,<br>
can I Bloom twice and use the same creatures power for both?<br>
<br>
Checking the rules, we find where a power can only be used once per turn,<br>
but Bloom says "immediately use any one Power on one of your cards in play"<br>
so we are not sure if that overrides the rules about one use per turn.<br>
Since the rule-book was not originally designed with doing things on your<br>
opponents turn in mind, we are having trouble trying to figure out the<br>
"intent-guidelines" on this one.<br>
<br>
RT - No, you may still only use a Power once per turn, under normal<br>
circumstances. If you Bloom twice, you cannot choose the same Power a second<br>
time, even if both Blooms are played simultaneously, you would resolve them<br>
in the order you choose.<br>

Orothe creatures that discard energy from opposing creatures discard<br>
two additional energy. Your Spells, Powers, and Effects can not<br>

Would I be able to use Shatterfire to discard a relic from play? Or<br>
would Pyromancy prevent me from even using Shatterfire? When The Last<br>
Words states, "Your Spells, Powers, and Effects can not discard<br>
energy from opposing Magi," does it refer only to spells, powers, and<br>
effects that explicitly discard energy directly from a Magi? It's<br>
rather vague. Raxis implicitly allows the targeted relic's Magi the<br>
option of discarding four energy. Seeing how it is at the option of<br>
the opposing Magi("MAY discard four energy"), I could see how this<br>
might be an exception. I could also see that it could work a<br>
different way, by not allowing the option of the opposing Magi to<br>
discard energy at his or her option, the relic is automatically<br>
discarded from play. Finally, I could also see that Shatterfire could<br>
be completely useless in this case because one part of the power is<br>
prevented so the rest probably is too. Just wanted a top-end opinion<br>

RT - Even though Shatterfire gives the opponent a choice of taking the<br>
energy loss, it is still energy being discarded from a Magi by one of your<br>

to let the Relic be discarded, and then would lose no energy.<br>

When you have a Magi that states that you can get "any X" starting cards,<br>
how exactly does this work? I was under the impression that you could just<br>
go get the cards that qualify, but was told today that this is not the case.<br>
For an example, I will use Sorreah...<br>
<br>
At the league today, I turned over Sorreah as my second Magi. Sorreah has<br>
STARTING: Any two Arderial Spells. I went into my deck to grab a couple of<br>
Crushing Winds, and was made aware that I have to go through my discard pile<br>
first. In my discard pile was only two spells: Lightning and Shooting Star.<br>
I was told that because these two qualify and because I have to go through<br>
the discard pile first, I had to choose these two.<br>

I am not so much disagreeing with the fact that this may be the ruling,<br>

RT - Though they say 'Any', this does not mean you can name a card and go<br>
get it. You still must search your discard pile first and choose amongst the<br>
cards there if any qualify; once you've done that, you may then search your<br>
deck and choose the rest. If you started with Yaki and Tony was next, when<br>
Tony was revealed if there were only an Arboll, Furok, and Weebo in the<br>
discard pile, then Tony would have to take the Furok and then choose either<br>
the Arboll or weebo as his "any" Creature. (He could, however, take the<br>
Furok as his 'any', then search his deck for a second Furok.)<br>

SPECIAL: Who does what?<br>
<br>
In Magi-Nation DUEL, the cards and rules are written with the notion that<br>
the Magi is the one using the Powers and Effects on themselves and their<br>
Relics as well as the one playing their cards. Creatures are the ones using<br>
their printed Powers and Effects. The player is the one actually making the<br>
decisions for the Magi and the Creatures, effectively taking on these<br>
'roles', while the Magi and Creatures carry them out.<br>
<br>
This distinction is important, because there are times when a card will<br>
restrict what someone can do, usually naming Magi or Creature(s)<br>
specifically, meaning the Magi or Creature(s) respectively are affected;<br>
however, there are cases when there is no distinction made. In these<br>
instances, it is the player that is affected, having the ability to make the<br>
decision of performing an action removed from them. For example:<br>
<br>
The Effect - Suppress states that 'other Magi cannot use their Powers or<br>
Effects'. This specifically names Magi, and means that Magi are affected, so<br>
that if any victim of Suppress had some countermeasure that would let their<br>
Magi not be affected by an opposing Effect, then the Magi could be protected<br>
from the effects of Suppress.<br>
<br>
The Power - Lockdown, on the other hand, states only "Name a Power or<br>
Effect...the named Power or Effect cannot be used as long as Rayje's Belt is<br>
in play". This Power makes no distinction whether Magi, Creatures, or etc.,<br>
are affected, so this restriction applies to the players, as it encompasses<br>
everything that could have a Power or Effect matching the one named.<br>
Therefore, even if a Creature cannot be affected by Powers, if it has a<br>
Power or Effect that has been named by Lockdown, it cannot be used.<br>

1. A few questions have come up and well we need answers...<br>
<br>
A. XYX Elder vs Rayje's Sword<br>
<br>
XYX Elder's power Shockstorm states that "Roll one die. Discard that<br>
much energy from each non-XYX creature in play."<br>
<br>
The way I read it is that this power doesn't even target XYX<br>
creatures to begin with so there is in fact no energy loss<br>
prevention currently happening. So "Piercing" wouldn't allow XYX<br>
creatures to get blasted as well.<br>
<br>
RT - It doesn't even choose Xyx Creatures to discard energy from; so the<br>
Xyxes will lose nothing, even if Piercing is in effect.<br>
<br>
B. Elios and Rayje's Belt<br>
<br>
Elios has the Effect: Dream Hard which states..."At the begining of<br>
your Energize step, if Elios is able to energize, choose a number<br>
less than his energize rate. Reduce Elios's energize rate by the<br>
chosen number until the start of your next turn. During your draw<br>
step, draw cards equal to the number chosen instead of your normal<br>
two"<br>
<br>
Now if that effect is Belted does Elios get to draw his two cards at<br>
the end of the turn as per usually or because he couldn't set his<br>
Energize rate at all will he draw zero cards?<br>
<br>
RT - Dream Hard is the Effect that restricts his ability to draw two cards<br>
normally; if he cannot use it, then he simply draws two cards.<br>
<br>
C. Scyalla and Sarazen Outcast<br>
<br>
Both of these cards allow you to name a creature type...<br>
PLEASE...clarify this. Because in an earlier Rules Digest it was<br>
stated that any part of the Creatures Name is it's type...(I.E.<br>
ELDER Weebo, ELDER Xyx or GIANT Chogus, GIANT Carillion, GIANT<br>
Baldar) Those afforementtioned have nothing to do with each other<br>
other then a saying weather it is an old creature...or a friggen<br>
huge creature. With creature types like Jiles, Arbolls, Furoks I<br>
can understand they all come from the same family of creatures.<br>
Does the terms like Elder, Giant, Guardian, Pup, Stone, Magam...etc.<br>
mean that those could be named and Creatures of that type are chosen?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, they are in fact all related; a Giant Chogus and a Giant<br>
Carillion are both abnormally large breeds of the respective Dream<br>
Creatures, while Elders have something to distinct them as well (generally,<br>
an 'Elder' of a Dream Creature race is a Dream Creature that has been around<br>
a long, long time, and because of that has learned a few unique tricks of<br>
its own compared to the younger versions).<br>
<br>
Also, it would just create too many issues to try and differentiate; what<br>
defines a Creature type? A noun (in the context of Magi-Nation)? That works<br>
just fine when you apply it to something like Baldars, but what about<br>
Sarazens? There wouldn't be any way to distinguish Sarazens, as the term<br>
'Sarazen' is generally used as an adjective, though that's what the species<br>
is. You would just have a member of the 'Guard' Creature type and the<br>
'Outcast' type that, while we know are related, couldn't be. And art cannot<br>
be a guide either, because that's subjective without a huge rulings list<br>
along the lines of "These cards are in this family:", which is just clunky.<br>
<br>
Any singular word (plural or not) within a Dream Creature's card title is<br>
a Creature type. Even the seemingly unrelated ones, such as Ballistic,<br>
Elder, Chaos, Giant, etc. Within the context of the ecology of the<br>
Moonlands, these Creatures actually are related, as strange as it may seem.<br>

2. I was wondering, say I had a rala tail, a rala, and bazha's pendant or<br>
yricho in play. Could this series of events occur:<br>
<br>
Scenario 1:Player A plays a flame rudwot. Player A then uses the flame<br>
rudwot's burning branches. Am I right in assuming that with Yricho's<br>
athletic power I can now use one of my creature's powers three times in<br>
total.<br>
<br>
RT - No; each Paradwyn card that grants the additional use of the same<br>
Power grants it ONE additional time, not AN additional time. You could still<br>
use it twice, however.<br>
<br>
Scenario 2:I have a rala, a rala tail, and Bazha as my magi with a river<br>
abaquist as one of my creatures. Can I assume (much like the vault of<br>
knowledge key with warrior's boots) that I can use the power on the river<br>
abaquist to possess up to three creatures?<br>
<br>
RT - No; you would discard the River Abaquist as soon as you declared that<br>
you used the Power; no chance to use it again.<br>
<br>

Lazarus writes again:<br>

3. The ash hyren says that its power, devitalize, restores a creature to<br>
its starting energy. I understand when the text says restore to starting if<br>
the creature is below starting, but what does restoring a creature to its<br>
starting entail when it is taking it from being above starting? Is it<br>
discrding energy? Or is the excess energy just dissipated?<br>
<br>
RT - Devitalize can only be used if the Creature is above its starting<br>
energy; the energy is discarded.<br>

4. OK, looking through the card changes list on Magi-Nation's web page, I<br>
see that Secrets of the book was changed to limit the number of cards drawn<br>
to 4. Will Moss Quido be changed the same way? I ask because as I was<br>
showing a friend how to play the game tonight, he used his Moss Quido to<br>
draw 11 cards. This seems a bit excessive (and contrary to those who think<br>
Bograth cannot be a card drawing engine).<br>
<br>
Moss Quido: Power - Dark Secrets: Discard Moss Quido from play. Draw one<br>
card for each of your Bograth or Core Creatures in play, whichever is<br>
greater. Use this Power only before your Attack Step.<br>
<br>
Secrets of the Book: Power - Secrets: (3) Choose any one opposing<br>
player. The chosed player reveals his or her hand to all players. Draw one<br>
card for each Creature revealed, and one card for each non-Creature Naroom<br>
card revealed, to a maximum of four.<br>
<br>
RT - Errata is a worst-case scenario situation; until Moss Quido is an<br>
element in an unstoppably broken deck (not very likely, since it really only<br>
workes in a swarm deck), it will not be considered for errata.<br>

Hanoka asks again:<br>
<br>
5. Got a question on the spells Darkness and "Ummm...NO!"<br>
<br>
Darkness: Umtil the end of the turn, all of your Bograth Creatures in<br>
play gain "Power - Darkness: Discard this Creature from play. Choose an<br>
opposing Creature in play. Discard the chosen Creature from play. Use this<br>
Power only before your Attack Step."<br>
<br>
"Ummm..NO!": Play "Ummm..NO!" only when an opponent plays a Spell that<br>
specifically discards one of your Creatures from play. Your Creature is not<br>
discarded from play. You may play "Ummm..N!" during your opponent' turns.<br>
<br>
My question is: If my opponent uses Darkness and then goes to discard one<br>
of my creatures, can I play "Ummm..NO!" to prevent that creature from being<br>
discarded? Or since it's now a power on a creature, would that not work?<br>
<br>
RT - No; the Spell grants a Power to all of the Creatures, and it is that<br>
Power that discards the Creature. All the Spell does is grant the Power of<br>
Darkness.<br>

6. Question<br>
If the Dreamwarp effect is mandatory and if I can dreamwarp for zero.<br>
Then Vine Hyren will always get 1 energy when a creature with<br>
dreamwarp is play, right?<br>
<br>
I was a bit confuse because the Hyren says "Whenever one of your<br>
other creatures uses the effect Dreamwarp". Since it say "uses" I<br>
guess that I have to increase or drecrease by 1 the creature play in<br>
order to gain 1 energy on Vine Hyren.<br>
<br>
RT - No; effectively, unless Dreamwarp is under the effect of 'Lockdown'<br>
or something similarly restrictive, Dreamwarping for 0 satisfies the Vine<br>
Hyren's need for you to "use" Dreamwarp. The reason that the Vine Hyren<br>
simply doesn't say "whenever you play a Creature with Dreamwap..." is<br>
because, as in the case mentioned, Locking down Dreamwarp shuts down the<br>
energy gain as well, with the current wording; functionally different from<br>
just gaining energy when a Dreamwarper is played.<br>
<br>
Another question<br>
Jungle Hyren have and effect also called dreamwarp. So if I have<br>
Jungle Hyren and Vine Hyren in play and I play any other creature<br>
without dreamwarp and I use the Jungle's effect. Does the Vine Hyren<br>
will gain one energy, since have the same name?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; more evidence that, if you're Dreamwarping, Vine Hyren is almost<br>
a staple, albeit expensive.<br>

7. Ok, here's the situation. In a multiplayer game, I'm playing<br>
against player A and player B. I have a Dryte Fiend in play. At<br>
the begging of Player A's turn, I name Player B's Furok Guardian that<br>
is at 10 energy to be "Condemned". Player A casts "stalk" on the<br>
condemned Furok Guardian. He then attacks the Furok Guardian with a<br>
3 energy Vine Hyren.<br>
<br>
A)Will the Furok Guardian lose 4 energy before energy is removed<br>
because of Condemn?<br>
<br>
RT - "Losing energy from attacks" means "loses energy when Creatures<br>
discard energy during the remove energy step". The Creature would only lose<br>
one from Stalking.<br>
<br>
B)Will the Furok Guardian also lose the 3 additional energy from the<br>
attack?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, it would.<br>
<br>
C)How will the energy resolve?<br>
<br>
First, Stalking removes one energy, reducing the Guardian to nine. Then,<br>
the Hyren and Guardian discard energy from each other; the Hyren assigns<br>
three to the Guardian, which Condemn increases to six, while the Guardian<br>
assigns nine to the Hyren. The Guardian survives the fight with three<br>
energy.<br>
<br>
Now go through this and replace the Furok Guardian with a Pylofuf.<br>
<br>
D)How will the energy resolve then?<br>
<br>
RT - Stalking will still remove one energy from the P-fuf, then Burrow<br>
will reduce the six energy discard to two. Condemn doesn't discard energy<br>
itself, it increases the amount of energy discarded by the offending<br>
mechanic in question.<br>

8. Hey I have a question about two cards and how in fact they work<br>
together...<br>
<br>
Awakening and Kyg'n<br>
<br>
Awakening states..."At the beginning of yournext turn if you have<br>
all 5 shadow geysers in play. Defeat all opposing Magi Stacks."<br>
<br>
Kyg'n states..."Effect: True Grit- Kyg'n is not defeated even if he<br>
has no energy and no creatures in play...until he is directly<br>
attacked."<br>
<br>
Now certain logic dictates that Awakening would over ride this<br>
effect...However it has already been made clear that cards in play<br>
thier abilities take Precedent over new cards played...Hrada and<br>
Ryaje's Boots/Band. So my question is would Kyg'n be defeated by<br>
Awakening if he was in play first...or...would Awakening win out...<br>
<br>
RT - The ruling isn't that cards take precedence in play order; it's<br>
specifics. Having said that, it does not interact with the ruling in this<br>
situation.<br>
<br>
True Grit simply names the generally accepted defeat condition of a Magi<br>
having no energy in play. If a card specifically defeats a Magi, barring an<br>
Effect that says "This Magi cannot be defeated unless they are reduced to<br>
zero energy and have no Creatures in play", then the Magi is gone.<br>
<br>
Of course this leads to another question...<br>
<br>
Kyg'n vs Ritual Spear...<br>
<br>
If as stated above Kyg'n can be defeated only in an attack...can you<br>
even use the Ritual Spear on him?<br>
<br>
RT - Again, yes; True Grit does not interact with specific defeat effects.<br>

1. Well I'm worried a bit about the Companionship effect.<br>
<br>
Question:<br>
In order for Furlosk to survive there has to be in play one creature<br>
from each region. Since it doesn't say anything like "at the end of<br>
the turn" or "at the beginning of your turn", then this card will be<br>
discard immediately after play.<br>
<br>
With this wording I can't play 2 Furlosk to complete requirements, if<br>
I have no creatures or just creatures from one region, right?.<br>
<br>
Bograth and Narrom are regions that don't get along. And there are no<br>
other Bograth/Narrom creatures to Furlosk be playable.<br>
<br>
RT - Companionship does require that you have both a Naroom Creature and a<br>
Bograth Creature under your control when Furlosk enters play. If you cannot<br>
fit this requirement, it is discarded immediately, meaning you would not be<br>
able to play one then another to keep both in play, since playing Creatures<br>
is sequential, not simultaneous.<br>

no damage to my creatures. is this legal? i would think so because<br>
the korrits are all attacking with pack hunt with another korrit,<br>
except the last one, who is pack hunting with a parmalag, but i<br>
wanted to make sure.<br>
<br>
RT - Every Korrit you have that may Pack Hunt may be involved in the same<br>
attack. In your scenario, they would all be Pack Hunting with the Parmalag,<br>
the Creature actually making an 'attack', as defined within the rules. This<br>
would count as all of their attacks for the turn, of course.<br>

3. Will the great throne of mushrooms allow the mage to pay one energy<br>
whenever a creature is discarded from play whether from attack,<br>
energy descard, or specific discard?<br>
<br>
i believe that the great throne of mushrooms allows for you to pay<br>
one whenever one of your creatures is discarded from play to draw a<br>
card; however, my tournement director disagrees with this claiming<br>
that it applies only to specific discard.<br>
<br>
RT - The term 'specific discard' will be done away with in future sets to<br>
prevent such confusion. That being said, the Great Throne Mushrooms only<br>
asks that a Creature leave play and be placed into the discard pile by a<br>
'discard' effect, i.e., the Creature being reduced to zero energy and being<br>
discarded from play (such as combat) or the Creature being directly<br>
discarded (such as Shockwave). Therefore, Enduring Renewal is triggered by<br>
Creature defeat in combat, Creature discard by a Spell, Power, or Effect, or<br>
even Creature discard as a cost to use a Power or another card. (Yes, by the<br>
wording of Enduring Renewal, you can even pay one to draw a card when you<br>
activate your Moss Quido to draw even more.)<br>

4. In regards to Kybar's Fang and Agram's Plaything:<br>
<br>
What is the "starting energy" for these two creature/relics? If someone<br>
wanted to Dream Balm them, Shadow Bones them, Ambush them or Vim and Vigor<br>
them what would happen? It has not happened to me yet, but I have gotten<br>
into the habit of putting Bloom in almost every deck I have. This would<br>
allow me to activate Kybar's Fang on my opponent's turn so that I may defend<br>
with it but doing so would open it up to spells that they could cast that<br>
need to know a starting energy. Also, though there is not much reason to<br>
want to (because in most instances you take a loss in overall energy), what<br>
if someone wanted to use something on their own turn that relied on starting<br>
energy?<br>
<br>
RT - If a value is not printed on a card (such as starting energy for a<br>
Relic), then that value has a default of zero. You may still use cards to<br>
increase it above zero (like Bagala Fangs) as long as it is a Creature, and<br>
those effects will stick around until their duration passes, even if the<br>
Creature becomes a Relic again (though they still would be unable to gain<br>
energy if not a Creature).<br>

5. I have a newbie question since I couldn't find it in my search<br>
through the database and the magiduel.com page. It's probably cause I<br>
didn't look hard enough but here my question is.<br>
<br>
I don't quite understand the multiple uses of the verb "attack". Such<br>
as the Kybar's Teeth creature Agrilla's effect Invulnerability:<br>
Agrilla loses one less energy in attacks.<br>
<br>
Does this mean when Agrilla attacks? Does it mean when he is<br>
attacked? Or, does it mean in all instances where he is involved in<br>
an attacks as either defender or attacker?<br>
<br>
Also, the Weave/Naroom creature Bungaloo's effect Flee: Whenever<br>
bungaloo is defeated in an attack,. . .<br>
<br>
Does this resolve only when he is the defender, or also in any attack<br>
wether he is defender or attacker?<br>
<br>
When it says specifically "When x creature attacks", or "When x<br>
creature is attacked" I understand how it is resolved, but on<br>
instances like those I am confused.<br>
<br>
RT - Whenever a card effect does not differentiate whether or not the<br>
Creature involved has to be attacking or defending, then it applies to every<br>
attack the Creature is involved in. In both of your examples, the Effects<br>
trigger whether the Creature is the attacker or defender.<br>

6. I've got a few questions I need answered in print.<br>
A)If my opponent casts Harmony, and I have an Arderian Guard Wings in<br>
play, are all my creatures above 5 reduced to 5 instead of 3? I am<br>
pretty sure, but just want to confirm.<br>
<br>
RT - Harmony will attempt to discard X energy from each Creature in play<br>
with more then three energy, where X = (Current energy - 3). Feathered<br>
Protection will reduce this amount on each of your Creatures by up to two,<br>
so effectively, all of your Creatures with five or less energy will lose<br>
nothing, and all of your other Creatures above five will be reduced to that<br>
amount.<br>
<br>
B)Agram's Plaything's power, Puppetstrings, would trigger effects<br>
that look for energy gain, like Trask's Lifetap, right?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; for this reason, Jip is a very effective counter to Kybar's<br>
Fang.<br>
<br>
C)Crushing Fungus affects my magi, right?<br>
<br>
RT - Not necessarily; Crushing Fungus affects the Magi that controls the<br>
Creature discarded by it. For purposes of Climbing Staff (which is where I<br>
think this question was headed), however, the Crushing Spell has already<br>
affected a Creature. Since the Staff can only prevent actions that would<br>
affect 'only your Magi', you cannot use the Staff to stop Crushing Fungus.<br>
<br>
D)I've gotten so mixed up and confused over the rules<br>
governing "move" could you please write up the most current<br>
explanation on how move would work in situations where energy loss is<br>
prevented?<br>
<br>
RT - If the amount of energy that will be discarded by a move effect is<br>
reduced, then the amount added will be reduced by an appropriate amount.<br>

7. If I cast Gloom against my opponent (discard all creatures, the<br>
controller<br>
may pay 1 energy or discard 1 card to save the createure),<br>
and he cast Spectral Shield, does the shield activate? My card did<br>
not force him to discard, it was his own choice. How about vs Gilded<br>
Cage?<br>
<br>
RT - Even if a card allows your opponent a choice of punishments (such a<br>
card discard or energy removal), regardless of what they choose, you still<br>
control the effect, so you still "force" it to happen (such as card<br>
discard), meaning a Giant Vulbor, if the opponent chose to discard cards to<br>
prevent the energy loss, would still be able to choose an Abraxin's Crown in<br>
their hand and cleave your Magi's energy with it, as well as your hand.<br>
<br>
In your example, if you discarded cards from your hand in order to satisfy<br>
Gloom, you would immediately draw a card to replace it. And since<br>
simultaneous effects are resolved sequentially (even when they occur<br>
simultaneously), you could have one card in your hand and effectively cycle<br>
through the top cards of your deck to save all of your Creatures in play,<br>
ending with a new card.<br>

Reddius asks again:<br>
<br>
8. Question A:<br>
Can I use Scyalla's Pet Project again with a Mirror Pendant,<br>
Sorreah's Dream or any other card that allow me to copy my Magi's<br>
power?<br>
<br>
RT - You may use and copy Pet Project as much as you want; however, the<br>
Power itself specifically states that the effects will only benefit the same<br>
player once per game. All other uses of it (including copies) are wasted.<br>
This is because Pet Project, when used (or copied for the first time), also<br>
creates the condition that you may only "name a non-Hyren Creature type.<br>
Until the end of the game, all Creatures of the chosen type that you play<br>
are Weave instead of their original region" once per game. Specifically,<br>
this means that any other card effect you have that has the same exact<br>
effect as what's stated above (such as a copy or using Pet Project again)<br>
cannot give any benefit.<br>
<br>
Question B:<br>
I have a Jile deck and I use Pet Project to convert all Jiles in<br>
Weave dream creatures and it says "all Jiles that I play".<br>
So, if I have a Chasm Jile in play and this one is attack by another<br>
creature. Can I play any Jile from my hand? Even Chaos Jile?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; when you play a Jile now, it is and always was a Weave Creature<br>
as soon as it leaves an out of play area and starts to enter the playing<br>
field.<br>

9. Orwin's Ring says "all spells in my discard pile are Narrom".<br>

What will happend if I have no spells in my discard pile? Can I add 1<br>

<br>
RT - If you have no Spells in your discard pile, then the statement "all<br>
of the Spells in your discard pile are Naroom" is correct; you will gain the<br>
benefits of the ring.<br>
<br>
There has also been question of what happens if Orwin's Ring is used by a<br>
Magi that is not Naroom (such as Bria, Tony, or a Magi tainted by Hrada). By<br>
the text of the card, all non-Naroom cards that the player of the Ring has<br>
in play are discarded, if it triggers; including Magi. Consider this Orwin's<br>
last contingency to sabotage those who aren't pure enough to use his ring<br>
(and a very powerful one at that).<br>

in play, you may keep all of your others but that one shadow geyser.<br>

11. Targ'n<br>
Effect - Enhanced Invulnerability: All of your creatures in play with<br>
invulnerability lose one less energy in attacks.<br>
<br>
Rock Hyren<br>
Your Spells, Power and other effects may not prevent Rock Hyren from<br>
losing energy.<br>
<br>
Question:<br>
Enhanced Invulnerability is adding one more to Rock Hyren's<br>
Invulnerability or not?<br>
Or Targ'n effect doesn't work on Rock Hyren since is an effect and is<br>
reducing energy loss in attacks.<br>
<br>
RT - Enhanced Invulnerability reduces damage itself; even if<br>
Invulnerability cannot be used, Enhanced Invulnerability would still reduce<br>
the energy loss of combat to those Invulnerable Creatures by one. But, since<br>
Enhanced Invulnerability reduces energy removal itself instead of just<br>
increasing the effectiveness of Invulnerability, so Rock Hyren cannot<br>
benefit from it.<br>

1. Can Tomes of the great library circumvent the restriction on crushing<br>
spells? I think not, but wanted to get verification.<br>
<br>
RT - The restrictions on the Crushing cards are specific restrictions, not<br>
the regional restrictions described in the rulebook. Unless your Magi may<br>
already legally play them, you cannot play them with Research.<br>

2. I'd also like to know one thing. Can you get Shadow Gysers with Tomes,<br>
and not have to discard them? I don't think so, but I just wanted to be<br>
sure.<br>
<br>
RT - Spells that stay in play, still stay in play; you process any extra<br>
effects (such as shuffling it into the opponent's deck) once you finally<br>
discard it from play, either from Spell resolution, Magi defeat, Beam of<br>
Light, and the like. Also note, you cannot play a Geyser unless you pay ALL<br>
costs (including discarded Creatures, Relics, cards in hand, etc).<br>

3. I have a question on this power and a possible loophole concerning it.<br>
<br>
Pet Project: Once per game, choose any one non-Hyren Creature type. Until<br>
the end of the game, all Creatures of the chosen type that you play are<br>
Weave Creatures instead of their original region.<br>
<br>
Now in previous rulings, it has been stated that any word that appears in a<br>
creature's name can be selected as the type (ie. "Giant" or "Parmalag" for<br>
Giant Parmalag.) So if someone were to choose for example, Forest for<br>
creature type, would they be able to play the Forest Hyren as a Weave<br>
creature?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; design intent was only to restrict the broad range of all Hyrens.<br>
If Hyren incidentally fall into the Creature type named (such as with<br>
'Forest'), then you get to play some Hyren as Weave Creatures.<br>

4. I understand that rayje's sword rips through burrow like a hot knife<br>
through butter, but what about stuff like lovian and crystal parmalag?<br>
Does sword negate only energy protection, or spell and power<br>
protection as well?<br>
<br>
RT - Piercing stops energy loss reduction; which interacts differently with<br>
varying levels of resistance. Creatures that are only immune to being<br>
discarded have no interaction at all with piercing. Creatures like Lovian<br>
are still immune to all other effects of Spells and Powers, with the only<br>
exception of energy discard.<br>

5. If I put two Tunnel Hyrens in play, can ainjer's grr remove more than<br>
2 energy from either? if so, does that negate all burrow effects and<br>
spells?<br>
<br>
RT - Grr can discard energy in excess of two against opposing Creatures with<br>
Burrow; in this case, your Tunnel Hyren is an opposing Creature. This<br>
doesn't negate Burrow, it just means that Burrow doesn't reduce the energy<br>
lost by Grr.<br>

6. scenario<br>
I play warrior's boots, and use them to play ormagon, then as i use<br>
ormagon's power, my opponent drops bloom, and plays ambush(i think<br>
it's ambush, it's the spell that removes energy equal to starting<br>
from a creature). How does this end? Does the 'gon get discarded or does it<br>
go<br>
nuke and wipe out his creatures?<br>
<br>
RT - Depends on when your opponent wishes to Bloom; they can't try to<br>
interrupt you in the middle of using a Power (such as the scenario stated).<br>
In your example, it can happen at three different points: When the Warrior's<br>
Boots are played, when Warpath is used, or when Devastate is used.<br>
Regardless of when, the Power gets to resolve before you resolve Bloom.<br>
<br>
Of course, when the Boots are played, there is nothing to Ambush, so that<br>
wouldn't be the most opportune time. When Warpath is used, the Ormagon is in<br>
play, and would be perfect to be Ambushed. Otherwise, once Devastate is<br>
used, the ten energy to use it will be gone from the Ormagon (meaning it<br>
probably will be as well), as well as all non-Underneath Creatures in play.<br>
<br>
Therefore, it seems your opponent wanted to respond to Devastate; which is<br>
too late. They can Bloom/Ambush in response to the Devastate, but the<br>
Bloomed Spell or Power cannot be used until the Power it's responding to has<br>
resolved.<br>

7. I have noticed that a lot of Bograth cards have text that includes<br>
Core cards in them... Is there some new rule that allows Bograth magi<br>
to play Core cards, or vice versa?<br>
<br>
RT - No; the rules on non-Core Magi not being able to play Core cards have<br>
not changed. A Magi may play any card of their region(s) ignoring<br>
restrictions and penalties; many cards are Bograth/Core, and in that case,<br>
all of them can be played by Bograth Magi.<br>

8. Some cards say "Starting: " and a Magi's name after them. What effect<br>
does this have on game play/deck construction/magi choice?<br>
<br>
An example of this is Rayje's Construct. At the bottom it says<br>
"Starting: Rayje".<br>
<br>
RT - All of these cards are considered to be printed on the 'Starting:'<br>
line of the named Magi. For instance, Rayje can always get a Construct with<br>
his other starting cards.<br>

9. "Choose any one Creature in play. Discard four energy from the<br>
chosen Creature. If the chosen Creature is discarded from play, play<br>
a Bograth Creature from your hand with two energy instead of it's<br>
starting energy. That Creature cannot attack this turn."<br>
<br>
My question is, do you have to spend the energy to play that<br>
creature? You wouldn't think so, -but-, other Bograth cards I've<br>
seen with powers or effects that result in you playing a creature,<br>
specifically state that you "ignore all costs". Was it simply an<br>
oversight on Crushing stench, or do you have to pay for the creature?<br>
<br>
RT - The Creature is played, ignoring all costs. As a general rule of thumb,<br>
if a card doesn't mention an in- or decrease in the cost of the card, you do<br>
not have to pay for it. This is true for many alternate play cards in ND,<br>
including Ghazran, Crushing Stench, and the like. (The notable exception<br>
here is the Tomes of the Great Library)<br>

10. I was wondering how Dazzle works on Liriel's Cape.<br>
<br>
Effect - Dazzle: All of your Creatures with the Effect "Dreamwarp"<br>
have an additional three starting energy while they are in play.<br>
<br>
Does this mean that if I play a K'Teep Thumper which has Dreamwarp<br>
and a starting energy of 4, that he comes in at a 7 or does that mean<br>
if I use Dream Balm it will raise him to a 7?<br>
<br>
RT - This means that, as long as the Creature is actually in play, its<br>
printed starting energy is increased by three. This does not increase the<br>
cost to play the Creature, or add energy to it when it enters play. What it<br>
does do is allow restorative cards (such as Dream Balm) to have extra<br>
effect, while simultaneously running the risk of cards like Ambush being<br>
more damaging.<br>

11. If you've already answered this in a past rules digest please just<br>
point me to the digest in question.<br>
<br>
My question involves a situation in which you use Hyren's Call to<br>
bring out a Vine Hyren. The following occurs.<br>
<br>
You've brought out the Vine Hyren, but would like to use its<br>
Dreamwarp effect. Would I be correct that when you increase its<br>
starting energy by one using DreamWarp you must move one additional<br>
energy from your magi to the Vine Hyren if you want the Vine Hyren to<br>
come out with 8 energy?<br>
<br>
RT - Hyren's Call allows you to ignore the costs of playing the Hyren. If<br>
you can Dreamwarp the Creature, then the Creature will gain the energy for<br>
free.<br>

It could get really sticky, especially since the quill says: before<br>
any choices are made. And what happens when you throw obgren into<br>
the mix?<br>
<br>
RT - When effects occur simultaneously, the active player resolves first,<br>
then each player in the game's playing order. The active player's Overwrite<br>
resolves, then the next player's Overwrite.<br>

13. Sorry, but I'm curious about the Vine Hyren thing and Hyren's call. If<br>
you<br>
have a Tropical Hyren in play and two Jungle Hyrens and then you cast<br>
Radiant<br>
Spring twice, does that mean when you "Hyren's Call" the Vine Hyren comes<br>
into play with 24 energy costing a mere 7 energy? Seems a little broken.<br>
<br>
RT - Tropical Hyren increases each Dreamwarp by one. Each Radiant Spring<br>
increases each Dreamwarp by five. Finally, each Jungle Hyren can Dreamwarp<br>
for two, not just one. Final tally?<br>
<br>
1st Jungle Hyren Warp: +13.<br>
2nd Jungle Hyren Warp: +13.<br>
Vine Hyren's Dream Warp: +12.<br>
<br>
A 45 energy Vine Hyren. Considering it took you six specific cards as well<br>
as the cost to get them all into play, and the fact one simple Shockwave<br>
will negate the advantage, not broken at all.<br>
<br>
Also - Can you use "Brush Fire" from your discard pile for the FireFly<br>
Amulet<br>
discard requirement?<br>
<br>
RT - No; you may only play Brushfire as if it were in your hand. Otherwise,<br>
it's still a card in the discard pile.<br>

14. We were playing a game last night when the question came up. Now that<br>
precedence for discarding magi from play has been set with orwin's ring<br>
discarding tony jones should he play it, does that mean someone can use rod<br>
of coals with abraxin's crown to snuff out a magi?<br>
<br>
RT - No; Abraxin's Crown only applies to energy discard effects. Though Rod<br>
of Coals checks energy totals, it still is a specific discard effect, not<br>
energy discard.<br>

15. Do you have to have a magi in play<br>
to proccess discard-from-hand-to-prevent-something<br>
effects (ie, Crown, Fangs, Climbing Staff)? Or is it<br>
not technically playing a card. If you don't, then<br>
how does discarding fangs from your hand to prevent<br>
your opponent from discarding cards from hand work if<br>
there's no magi in play to follow the "until this magi<br>
is defeated" clause?<br>
<br>
RT - Such cards with discard activated effects are never played; you reveal<br>
the text to the opponent that explains why you are discarding it, or what<br>
benefit you are getting for it being discarded, then you place it in the<br>
discard pile.<br>
<br>
If you have such a card effect that refers to "until your Magi is defeated",<br>
and you have no active Magi, then the effect fizzles, since it cannot<br>
complete its action (giving your active Magi immunity to discard effects).<br>
<br>
With regards to cards like Climbing Staff, you cannot use its Effect if you<br>
do not have an active Magi. All Powers and Effects on Relics are used by<br>
their controller's active Magi; without a Magi active, you cannot use the<br>
Effect, just as the Magi could not use Climbing Staff in this manner if they<br>
could not use the Powers and Effects on their Relics (if they were pinned by<br>
Crushing Heat, for instance).<br>

Special Rules Section: Recent Errata<br>
I will list the Errata here with a brief explanation of how the new versions<br>
differ from the old. There has been a lot of mail on these subjects in the<br>
last few days, and if any future questions arise, please direct the<br>
questioner at this special examination.<br>
<br>
Liriel's Cape:<br>
The cost to play and cost to use Mass Heal were switched, so the new version<br>
requires a cost up front.<br>
Mass Heal requires the discarding of the Cape :before: any Creatures are<br>
restored. This means that Dazzle is not in effect when the Creatures are<br>
restored, and as such will only go up to their printed starting energy (not<br>
printed +3).<br>
<br>
Shell:<br>
The Spell now chooses a Magi, so you cannot protect your Creatures if you<br>
have just defeated an opposing Magi.<br>
Shell does not affect 'only your Magi or only your hand', so it cannot be<br>
prevented by Climbing Staff.<br>
Shell only protects against Spells and Magi Powers, not against those on the<br>
chosen Magi's Creatures or Relics.<br>
The card cannot be played on consecutive turns.<br>
Your own Spells and Powers will still affect your Orothe Creatures while<br>
Shell is in effect.<br>
<br>
Rayje:<br>
The only change here was the addition of the word 'Universal' to the Wily<br>
Ability. Thus, you can only grab cards like Beam of Light, Umm... No!, Heal,<br>
and such.<br>
<br>
Ring of Secrets, Rayje's Construct:<br>
These now work just the same as Rayje's Shield, in that each Creature can<br>
only be selected once by any effect called Tinker.<br>
If you have both a Ring and a Construct in play, you must choose two<br>
different, previously unchosen Creatures to receive the energy.<br>
<br>
In the odd case that a Ring or Construct leaves play and its ongoing effects<br>
are cancelled (as with Beam of Light), then the Ring or Construct returns to<br>
play in the same turn, the 'new' Ring or Construct will not 'remember' which<br>
Creatures it had previously chosen, so you can choose each Creature an<br>
additional time.<br>
<br>
Shadow Vinoc:<br>
The only change here was the addition of the word 'opposing'<br>
<br>
Undream cards:<br>
If you Undream your own Creature, your Magi cannot gain energy past the<br>
chosen Creature's starting energy.<br>
If you choose an opposing Creature with Alaban Gloves, the opposing Magi<br>
will gain whatever happens to be on the chosen Creature.<br>
<br>
Motash's Staff now only works when an opponent Undreams your Creatures.<br>
<br>
Inhibitor Band:<br>
All other Universal Relics are discarded (not bounced) when the Band is in<br>
play. While in play, Universal Relics cannot enter play from anywhere (the<br>
previous version only restricted them from being played from the hand).<br>
<br>
Furlosk:<br>
You now only require another Bograth or Naroom Creature to keep the Furlosk<br>
in play (not at least one of each).<br>
<br>
Mydra Swarm:<br>
The chosen Player may still freely draw during their Draw Step.<br>
<br>
Moob:<br>
You are now limited to using the Power during your first P/S/R phase, and<br>
the Moob must be at least 3 energy in size to use the Power.<br>
<br>
Moss Quido:<br>
Similar to the restriction on Secrets of the Book; you can only draw 4 cards<br>
at once with this Power.<br>
<br>
Blygt:<br>
The opponent-chosen Creature is shuffled into the deck before any of the<br>
Creatures are played, so 'being discarded' effects cannot be used. Shuffling<br>
the Creature into the deck limits future choices for Blygt, instead of<br>
seeing the same lose/lose/lose situation each turn.<br>
<br>
So, it sucks to contradict yourself. In previous Rules Digests, I stated<br>
that you could use Effects on cards in your hand (like Gilded Cage and such)<br>
when you had no active Magi; this is also implied in the first two<br>
paragraphs of entry 15 of this week's Rules Digest.<br>
<br>
For absolute clarity, you :can: use Climbing Staff (and similar cards) if<br>
you have no active Magi.<br>

1. on the kybers teeth creatures. invulnurability says "blank"<br>

is that only when the creature attacks, or is it also when the<br>
creature is attacked?<br>
<br>
RT - If the phrase "when attacking" or "when attacked" is not on the effect<br>
to make a distinction, then the Effect applies whenever the Creature is<br>
attacking or defending. In regards to Invulnerability, yes, the Creatures<br>
loses one less energy whether it is the attacker or defender.<br>
<br>
also. how does the regional penalty affect multi regional creatures<br>
and magi. I guess if your magi is from one of the 2 regions on the<br>
multi region card then they dont pay the penalty right? but what<br>
about multi region magi? if say for instance the magi is naroom and<br>
orothe does that mean they can play cards from both of those regions<br>
without the penalty?<br>
<br>
my friend got a magi card that is a weave card, but under the magi's<br>
name it says, weave/naroom magi.<br>
<br>
RT - A Magi may play cards of any of their specified regions ignoring<br>
regional restrictions and penalties. Your friend's Weave/Naroom Magi can<br>
play Naroom, Weave, Weave/Cald, Core cards playable by Naroom Magi, and any<br>
other card normally playable by any Naroom or Weave Magi. As for only having<br>
one region in its template, this is so that players who prefer the look of a<br>
specific region, or would like to keep their Magi appearance consistent (for<br>
instance, in an otherwise single-region deck).<br>

2. For the spell Nightmares Dawn, I need a clarification on what counts<br>
as a card for a magi, does the magi itself count as a card from their<br>
region for nightmare's dawn, or do i need another card?<br>
<br>
RT - The Magi does not have itself in play; the Magi's cards in play are<br>
their Spells (if not discarded when used), Creatures, and Relics. These are<br>
what count for Nightmare's Dawn.<br>
<br>
I have a belt in play, and I belt my<br>
opponents "bad power", their magi is defeated, and the card with "bad<br>
power" leaves play, their next magi plays another card with "bad<br>
power". Is the "bad power" still locked down?<br>
<br>
RT - Lockdown does not depend on the offending Power or Effect remaining in<br>
play, and does not "shut off" until the Belt itself leaves play or the<br>
duration of Lockdown ends. As such, if your opponent has, for instance, Evu<br>
in play, and you Lockdown Lore before defeating him, the opponent could not<br>
then reveal their Magi next turn then play and use Book of Ages.<br>

3. can anyone tell me how Dreamwarp works.<br>
my friend got it on a paradwyn card called rala and neither of us<br>

<br>
RT - Whenever you play a Creature with Dreamwarp, under normal<br>
circumstances, you may decide to play it with its printed starting energy<br>
raised or lowered by one (to a minimum of one). Raising it increases both<br>
the cost to play and the amount of energy it enters play with by one.<br>
Reducing it lowers the cost and the energy it enters play with by one as<br>
well. Regardless, at the end of that turn, the Creature's starting energy<br>
returns to the number printed on the card (note that when the starting<br>
energy changes, this does not change the current energy of the Creature).<br>

Vines stack?<br>
<br>
RT - Alpine Xamf's Effect does not enter play until the Xamf enters play; at<br>
such a time, it is too late for the Xamf to gain the energy.<br>
<br>
Unless noted otherwise in the description of the Effect, all Effects that<br>
act similarly (in this case, Robe of Vines and Alpine Xamf) stack.<br>

Does this mean that if I play Firefly Swarn or discard a Cald card to<br>
Firefly amulet (or anything like that that says "one creature"), I can<br>
instead target a Magi with the spell or power?<br>
<br>
RT - As long as the Magi is otherwise eligible (for instance, not Cald in<br>
the case of Firefly Swarm), then yes. However, since Magi do not attack, but<br>
their Creatures do, then the other effects of the Firefly cards are not<br>
applicable here.<br>

6. Ok, so now I have a question, because this ruling in itself<br>
contradicts a previous ruling. A previous ruling stated that if I<br>
used Crushing Heat on my opponent's creature and it discarded the<br>
creature from play, a magi could not use the "pitch" Effect on the<br>
climbing staff because the magi was considered to be "using" the<br>
effect, and therefore couldn't because of Crushing Heat.<br>

How does this interaction now work being that the Climbing Staff<br>

So my question is: Does the Magi use the effect as stated here? If<br>
so, then when there is no active magi, you can't use climbing staff.<br>
If not, then Crushing Heat has no effect on Climbing Staff because<br>
the player plays it, not the Magi. Which is it?<br>
<br>
RT - There has been some inconsistency in previous rulings, and that's<br>
cleared up with this simple rule: If a card has 'game text' (like TJ, AC, or<br>
Underlord's Shield) you do not need an active Magi to play the card. You<br>
need an active Magi to use any 'Effect' on a card, even the ones in your<br>
hand (this means you cannot play Climbing Staff from your hand while you<br>
have no active Magi).<br>

6. Looking over some cards today.<br>
<br>
Climbing staff can not stop impact because impact effects both the<br>
creature being discarded and the Magi right?<br>
<br>
RT - Impact affects both the discarded Creature and the chosen Magi, and<br>
cannot be prevented with Climbing Staff.<br>
<br>
Can Abraxin's Crown be discarded for Storm of Fishes if they pick Relics?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; if you played the Storm, then nothing happens. If the opponent<br>
played the Storm, you may discard the Crown "instead" of another of your<br>
Relics, as well as getting the benefit from it.<br>

7. Does Flame Hyren's power 'Energy Transfer' count as "energy gain" for the<br>
creatures receiving its energy or, like Flame Control, does this count as<br>
"rearrange?"<br>
The power says to "distribute" Flame Hyren's energy. I was curious if<br>
this triggered Effects that go off when something gains energy... like<br>
Nara's Rare Spirit.<br>
<br>
RT - Flame Hyren adds energy to the Creatures you distribute its energy to.<br>
This would not trigger Nara's Rare Spirit, however, as that only works with<br>
Cald Spells.<br>

8. With the new Motash Staff wording. Does it still works with<br>
D'Jarvish when a creature burrow or Illusionary is being discarded?<br>
<br>
RT - D'Jarvish's Effect is a replacement effect; the Creature is returned to<br>
the hand instead of discarded, but the source of that is still the opposing<br>
card.<br>
<br>
If the opponent Shockwaved one of D'Jarvish's Pylofufs (or any other<br>
eligible Creature) while he had Motash's Staff in play, he would still get<br>
the energy that the Creature had returned to him.<br>

Reddius asks again:<br>
<br>
9. I want to know if Korrits are affected by Rayje's Sword Pircing<br>
effect? And if the korrit is affected, how damage is divide?<br>
<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
There is a Rayje's Sword in play and I have a 3 energy parmalag and a<br>
5 energy Giant Korrit. My opponent have a 8 energy Yarothis. So I<br>
attack with my Parmalag and my Giant Korrit join the attack. Does the<br>
Giant Korrit lose energy? How much energy will it lose since Parmalag<br>
was also attacking? Is the energy divide in any way? Are both of my<br>
creatures discarded?<br>
<br>
RT - As far as the rules are concerned, Pack Hunt gives the Korrits an<br>
additional time when they can attack, but, otherwise, it is still an attack<br>
in and of itself. Pack Hunt also reduces the energy lost by the Korrit in<br>
the attack to zero.<br>
<br>
Normally, the defending Creature assigns its energy total to be removed from<br>
all attacking Creatures in the attack, as per the rules. Then, Pack Hunt<br>
reduces the energy to be removed from the Korrits to zero. With Piercing in<br>
Effect, Pack Hunt cannot reduce the energy loss. Example:<br>
<br>
Piercing is in Effect, and I attack my opponent's 5E Junjertrug with my 3E<br>
Bisiwog and Pack Hunt with my 5E Giant Korrit. Normally, the Junjertrug<br>
would lose 8E, the Bisiwog 5E, and the Giant Korrit nothing. However, since<br>
energy loss cannot be reduced, the Junjertrug discards 5E from the Giant<br>
Korrit as well. Final result: I lose my Giant Korrit and Bisiwog defeating<br>
your Junjertrug.<br>

Andrew writes again:<br>
<br>
11. I read in the rule book of the several kinds of effects. if it<br>
says "may" then you have the choice to use it and when during your<br>
turn to use it.<br>
<br>
but as far as mandatory effects. does the player have to use them at<br>
the very beginning of there turn, or can they use it at any time<br>
during there turn as long as they use it once per turn.<br>
<br>
if they can use it anytime then the player could cast a creature and<br>
then add energy to it. otherwise they'd have to play it on creatures<br>
that they already had in play fromt he turn before. I hope its the<br>
latter, but the book doesn't specify so if anyone can clarify this<br>
I'd appreciate it.<br>
<br>
RT - Effects, as long as you may use them, are always triggered whenever the<br>
conditions for them are met. These conditions can be as general as "whenever<br>
a Creature enters play" or so specific as "whenever you play a Naroom<br>
Creature". Whatever the case, if the Effect does not say that you "may" do<br>
it, or does not list a limited number of times to do it (such as once per<br>
turn), then you must carry out the instructions of the Effect each time its<br>
conditions are met, even if its your Effect and you don't want to.<br>

Lazarus asks again:<br>
<br>
12. To piggyback off of the Spectral Shield question: when you play multiple<br>
spectral shields, do their effects stack or no?<br>
<br>
RT - Unless otherwise noted in the text of it, all card effects stack, even<br>
redundant ones. You would get two draws for each one card lost.<br>

If a Magi has a dual region creature in play, say a Flame Rudwot<br>

<br>
RT - Dual-region cards are always considered to be both of their regions. If<br>
you are comparing regions of cards, and at least one region is a match, the<br>
cards are considered to be from the same region. In this case, Pruitt's<br>
Flame Rudwot is considered to be of Pruitt's region. The same would be true<br>
of Tryn Flamesaver's (Naroom/Cald) Bungaloo (Naroom/Weave).<br>

14. a)How exactly does Abwyn's Quill interact with cards that list the<br>

RT - Overwrite will replace all instances of the region in the Spell or<br>
Power.<br>
<br>
b)Can an opponent Use his Quill to "Overwrite" something that I<br>
already hvae overwritten? My instincts say no, because Overwrite is<br>
suposed to happen before any choices are made...<br>
<br>
RT - Both Overwrites will be triggered simultaneously; they will resolve in<br>
play order, beginning with the active player. This means that your Overwrite<br>
would resolve, letting you change the named region as you wish, then the<br>
opponent's will resolve, and they can Overwrite what you have just<br>
Overwritten.<br>

Shawn asks again:<br>
<br>
15. I know there are quite a few other people out there who are confused<br>
as to what exactly does everything, for the purposes of card<br>
interpretation.<br>
<br>
For example, who uses powers on relics? Player or Magi? Who<br>
processes effects on relics? Player or Magi? Who plays cards?<br>
Player or Magi? If a card is put into play from the deck or discard,<br>
does the magi play it or the player?<br>
<br>
A nice neat tidy list to reference from would be wonderful.<br>
<br>
RT - Here you are, then:<br>
<br>
All cards are played by Magi. Magi themselves are never 'played'.<br>
<br>
Powers and Effects and Creatures and Magi come from those specific cards.<br>
While you need a Magi in play to use a Power or Effect on a Relic, the Relic<br>
itself is still the source of the Power or Effect. If a card prevents a Magi<br>
from using Powers or Effects, but doesn't specifically say that the Magi<br>
can't use Powers or Effects on Relics, then the Relics can still be used.<br>
<br>
A good clear example is found by comparing Sandswirl to Crushing Heat; the<br>
former says 'The chosen Creature or Magi cannot use Powers or Effects...',<br>
while the latter says' the creature's Magi cannot use Powers or Effects or<br>
P/E on their Relics...'<br>

Entangle, on the other hand, does affect the Magi, and can be stopped by<br>

<br>
18. When a creature has the text "...removes x additional damage in attacks"<br>
is this additional energy removal affected by things like burrow or dodge?<br>
Or is the additional damage not counted because it is part of the attack<br>
itself?<br>
<br>
RT - The additional energy removal is added to the amount assigned to be<br>
removed normally by the attack, and can still be capped by Burrow and the<br>
like.<br>
<br>
 thought this was clear in the digest, but I'll re-reiterate.<br>
<br>
When you play Nightmare's Dawn, look at each of your Creatures in play. Ask,<br>
'Is this Creature the same region as my Magi?' If you ever answer 'No' then<br>
you do not get the energy. If you answer 'This Creature is both my Magi's<br>
region and another region' then you meant to say 'Yes.'<br>
<br>
A dual region card is always both of its regions. If one of the card's<br>
regions matches at least one region on another card you are comparing it to,<br>
they are of the same region. If none of the regions match (and only then),<br>
the cards are not the same region.<br>
<br>
Shaper's Apprentice can have a KT-Cleansed Ruid in play, and they are the<br>
same region.<br>
<br>
If you have a regular Ruid in play and played Blight, the Ruid would gain<br>
energy (since it is Core), but not lose energy (because the Ruid, being<br>
Core, cannot also be non-Core).<br>
<br>

RT - Gia may only play Relics with Unearth that she could legally play;<br>
under normal circumstances, this applies only to Universal and Weave Relics.<br>
She does not pay any cost for playing the Relics, however. Generally,<br>
unless the card includes phrase such as 'regardless of region' , you can<br>
only play Relics that you could normally play with the card.<br>

18. Dual Region appears to be the problem today.<br>
<br>
If a dual region card is in play (ie hurricane orish) would i then be able<br>
to play a spray narth for free, tecnically this is one other creature in<br>
play which satifies the conditions for the card?<br>
<br>
RT - Whenever a dual-region card's region is referenced, if it is of that<br>
region, it is only one region, the region referenced, and that region alone;<br>
it counts as either needed, so that the card suffers all benefits and<br>
drawbacks of being each region.<br>
<br>
If I have a bubble XyX in play then I go to play a hurricane orish with<br>
Voice as my Magi would the bubble XyX cause the magi's power to kick in on<br>
both causes even though it lacks the truthful requirements of 2 different<br>
region cards in play?<br>
<br>
RT - If you have played a dual region Arderial/Orothe Creature with Voice of<br>
the Storm, then each of your Arderial/Orothe Creatures cost two less for the<br>
remainder of the turn.<br>
<br>
and since a card is dual region as such I understand that it can never not<br>
be one of it's regions however that yields quite a problem getting to game<br>
play issues of the Voice speed deck, but would a card like say typhon<br>
possibly be used to discard energy from an Arderial/Orothe creature? (now<br>
realize I know it is an orothe creature and it is also an arderial<br>
creature.shouldn't there be a down side for these cheaper no regional<br>
penalty cards?<br>
<br>
RT - Typhoon will not discard energy from Arderial/Orothe Creatures because<br>
they are Orothe when Typhoon checks them.<br>

have him choose between keeping one of my creatures alive or killing<br>
me off that turn not keeping me alive at 1 energy?<br>
<br>
RT - No; because using a Power or Spell is not optional with Bloom, you<br>
could not play it then not use a Power or Spell. If you play bloom and have<br>
no powers or Spells to play, you have to take back the playing of the Bloom<br>
(and get that energy back).<br>
<br>
what happens when i play 2 or more blooms... do i have to announce<br>
them all at the same time then the spells im playing because of them<br>
in the oredr i choose?<br>
<br>
RT - You may only play one Bloom in response to each of your opponent's<br>
actions, as Bloom states that it must be played 'immediately after' your<br>
opponent does one of the listed actions. By the time you have processed one<br>
Bloom, it is no longer 'Immediately after' the original action took place.<br>

23. I have a Nkala and Bahzra's Pendant in play/Bloom in hand and 0e on my<br>

Bloom. I want to use them both (Pendant lets me use the Nkala to<br>
Support to 1e and then Bloom to use another power on one of my other<br>
cards in play). Even though the triggered effects both say<br>
"immediately after..." do I still get to choose the order to use the<br>
triggered effects. This is important here since it determines whether<br>
or not I can play the Bloom. Although the situation is artificial it<br>
is is useful to demostrate the timing case.<br>
<br>
Does the word "immediately" really have any importance? Lets say I<br>
have a Phrup in play and Bloom in hand. My opponent plays a<br>
Tomorrow's Jewel which triggers Bloom and Phrup. Phrup does not say<br>
immediately. Do I have to Bloom first and use my Epik in play before<br>
I Phrup, or can I choose to do the reverse (which, of course, is the<br>
smarter choice).<br>
<br>
RT - If you Phrup your opponent's Spell or Relic, he didn't actually play<br>
one, so you could not play Bloom (or a similar ability) at that time.<br>

<br>
RT - Phrup was made before the 'as' text template was used; for it to make<br>
any sense, it has to be used before the opposing card enters play, and<br>
before any of its effects have resolved. Therefore, if you Phrup your<br>
opponent's card, no Effects that would trigger from it coming into<br>

1. I have a question concerning K'teeb thumper's "thump" power. It says<br>
to choose a creature or magi in play that used a power on its last<br>
turn. Remove three energy from the creature or magi. Normally you<br>
would use this power during a powers/spells/relics phase on your own<br>
turn.<br>
<br>
So my question involves instances where Paradwyn spells or relics<br>
allow you to use a power on one of your cards on your opponent's turn<br>
(Bloom, Bazhas pendant, etc). My question involves the intent of the<br>
word "last". What is consdered to be the "last" turn of your<br>
opponent. If last means "previous" then you could only use thump only<br>
on those creatures or magi that used a power on the turn before your<br>
opponent's current turn. However if last means "most recent" (as it<br>
sometimes does) would that mean his current turn? In this case you<br>
could only thump creatures or magi that used powers on your opponents<br>
current turn.<br>
<br>
RT - "During X player's last turn" = "During X player's last completed<br>
turn". This means that you could still only Dreamthump something that had<br>
used a Power on your opponent's last turn, not something that has used one<br>
during the current turn.<br>

4. ok, here is a question i have with drought.<br>
<br>
drought states that "all cards in play gain no energy the next time<br>
they energize"<br>
<br>
<br>
i see 2 possible interpretation for this card.<br>
<br>
A. that all cards that are in play when drought is played don't<br>
energize the next time they are suppose to energize. i should be<br>
able to get around this by interchanging, using the ritual spear or<br>
killing off my own magi so that on my next energize step the magi<br>
doing the energizing was not in play when drought was played.<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
B. that the game checks when the cards are actually energizing.<br>
which means that even if i play drought after their magi is already<br>
defeated, their next magi would not be able to energize on their<br>
energize step.<br>
<br>
as you can see, these 2 interpretations differ greatly and would also<br>
affect the outcome of a game in the same way (greatly). obviously my<br>
question is which interpretation is correct? or perhaps there is a<br>
third way to interpret this card that i was not aware of?<br>
<br>
RT - Drought stops all cards in play under a player's control from gaining<br>
energy the next time that the player must energize, whether it is during the<br>
energize step, or from a card such as Flood of Energy. It will apply to<br>
every card in play during that next energize action, even ones that were not<br>
in play when Drought was played. This prevents you from benefiting from<br>
Drought if you Interchange, defeat your Magi, etc.<br>

The question that arose was this: Does this mean that I can't choose the<br>

discard pile to activate the power? OR, does it mean that I can't choose two<br>
of the same creature, even if I have two copies in my discard pile, such as<br>
choosing two Pylofufs, or two Grakandens?<br>

Personally, I figured that it'd allow me to choose two Pylofufs as long as<br>
I had two copies in the ol' discard pile, but there have been a lot of<br>

12. Wanted to get this on the main list since it is rather important (IMO)<br>
Before Worlds there was a ruling that I was not aware of and only<br>
learned of thru my teammate getting clobbered by it. It seems that<br>
you can now Phrup the discard of a climbing staff to prevent damage.<br>
Nowhere on Phrup or Climbing Staff can I see any reason for this to<br>
be possible so i was wondering exactly what brought this about.<br>
<br>
RT - The verb to 'play cards' in MND is to either a) put the card into<br>
play (as with a Creature or Relic) or to b) discard the card from your hand,<br>
follow the instructions on the card, and place it in the discard pile (as<br>
with Spells). Since Climbing Staff's Effect works exactly as b), it is<br>
considered to be played when this Effect is used.<br>
<br>
Any card that uses an Effect to emulate A) or B) above is being played,<br>
and can be hit by Time Lapse. Cards that use Rules text to do so do not<br>
count as being played, and cannot be stopped by a Phrup.<br>

RT - All cards are discarded simultaneously; you may choose to discard the<br>
Crown and Ring "instead" of two of your other Relics, to save them, but<br>
since the discard is simultaneous, the Moob Ring's anti-discard effect will<br>
not save the rest of your Relics in hand.<br>

<br>
A) If you play a spell from your draw pile using tomes of the great<br>
library and the spell says to place it on the table (ie shadow geysers) or<br>
on a creature (ie dream channel), will tomes still discard the spell?<br>
<br>
RT - The Tomes have been clarified to allow Spells that stay in play to<br>
remain as long as they are supposed to.<br>
<br>
B) Sorreah starts with any 2 arderial spells, and also sorreah's dream.<br>
how many sorreah's dream can you get when you reveal sorreah? When you go<br>
through your discard for the starting cards, if you come across a sorreah's<br>
dream, can you say that you pick that because it says Starting: Sorreah on<br>
it, then go to you draw pile (assuming no other spells in discard of course)<br>
and get one or two more Dreams?<br>
<br>
RT - The first Sorreah's Dream in your discard pile may be claimed as your<br>
Sorreah's Dream for starting, instead of one of your Arderial Spells, even<br>
if this now allows you to search your deck for two more, different Arderial<br>
Spells.<br>

Zoz asks again:<br>
<br>
16. First:<br>
With Twee it had been ruled that if he was controlled, and then killed,<br>
the controlling player would take advantage of the "get the next creature<br>
under Twee" effect. In light of this, what happens when a controlled Eebit<br>
gets nixed in an attack? Does it go back to it's owner's hand, or is it<br>
discarded because it can't really go into the hand of the controller?<br>
<br>
RT - The Eebit returns to its owner's hand, not its controller's.<br>
<br>
Second:<br>
If Korg's Poetry says that Korg can play it, can you play it with the Dual<br>
Magi "Korg & Zet"? The effect that prevents K&Z from playing relics is<br>
named Korg, and I know the story reason is that Korg is an idiot... but the<br>
effect reads that Korg & Zet cannot play relics. I know this was typed this<br>
way to reflect the card title... but some folks may not believe that K&Z can<br>
play Korg's Poetry because the effect also names Zet's inability to play<br>
relics. Then another player said "But, the poetry says Korg can play it.<br>
Doesn't that override the effect on the dual magi?" I honestly don't know<br>
what to think, so very long-windedly, I ask you guys now.<br>
<br>
RT - Korg is Korg is Korg; Korg & Zet is just as much Korg as Korg or<br>

18. Player 1 is playing an Underneath deck and all the cards Player 1 has<br>
in play are solely Underneath with no dual region cards. Player 2 is<br>
playing a Weave deck with 2 Weave Relics and a Weave/Naroom Baby<br>
Furok.<br>
<br>
Nightmare's Dawn reads:<br>
All Magi who only have cards of their region in play gain five energy.<br>
<br>
Question A: If Player 1 casts Nightmare's Dawn does Player 2 get the<br>
extra five energy on their Magi?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, Player 2's Magi receives the energy. A weave/Naroom card is<br>
always a Weave card, so it counts as being the same region as the Weave<br>
Magi.<br>
<br>
Basically, Nightmare's Dawn asks this question of each Magi: "This Magi is<br>
X region, where X is the region of the Magi. If all of the cards this Magi<br>
controls are X region, then this Magi gains five energy."<br>
<br>
In the example given, the Baby Furok is asked "Since your Magi is Weave,<br>
are you a Weave card?" and it responds "Yes" for that specific situation; if<br>
the next Spell the opposing player cast was Wildfire specifying Naroom, the<br>
Wildfire would ask the Baby Furok if it was Naroom, and so the Furok would<br>
answer 'yes', and therefore get burned.<br>
<br>
The only time the situation with Nightmare's Dawn can seem more<br>
complicated is when the Magi is dual-region as well; in that case,<br>
Creatures that are either of the Magi's regions would answer "Yes". So, if<br>
the opposing Magi was Taisa (Paradwyn/Weave) with the same cards in play,<br>
they would still get the energy since all of the Magi's cards are Weave.<br>
Additionally, Taisa could have a Paradwyn/Bograth card in play and still be<br>
ok.<br>

the order you choose. When you switch defenders with Weave Tactics, you<br>
reset all of the steps of the attack, and all of the Speags gain two energy<br>
yet again, since the defender is different. If you somehow switched to the<br>
original defender in the attack after Weave Tactics was used, though, the<br>
Speags woulds not trigger again (because Effects do not retrigger in an<br>

Also, If I've got an effect that triggers on opposing turns, and this<br>
effect triggers another effect, which also triggers another. Can I<br>
use all of my effects that triggered, or do I only get to use one in<br>
response to my opponents action? ex:Weave an energy to Weave Hyren,<br>
then activate Wild Groth, then Activate another wild growth.<br>
<br>
RT - You would resolve them as they are triggered; first, Weave would<br>
trigger and resolve, then the first Wild Growth, then the second Wild<br>
Growth. If the opponent had any effects with the same triggers as yours,<br>
then you would wait for them to resolve theirs before resolving the yours,<br>
and this could possibly interrupt you chain (such as their Effect discarding<br>
the source of your second Wild Growth, which wouldn't have already triggered<br>
since the energy had yet to be added from the first).<br>

1. Previously, I had asked if Energizing was counted as "energy gain," for<br>
situations like when I have a Jip and my opponent has a Jile and a bunch of<br>
other swamprats in play. It was ruled that energizing was not counted as<br>
"energy gain" for the purposes of triggering things triggered by "energy<br>
gain." In light of this, I need to ask a related question. Giant Chogus<br>
has the following: "Effect - Big Chill: Creatures in play cannot gain<br>
energy above their starting energy." This came from having the same<br>
Jile/lots-o-swamprats in play, but instead of a Jip we are looking at a<br>
Giant Chogus. Which of the following should it be treated as Giant Chogus<br>
stating? "Creatures in play cannot have their energy increased above their<br>
starting energy" or "creatures in play cannot benefit from an 'energy gain'<br>
that would increase them above their starting energy."<br>
This scenario basically stems from a broader question: Are there times<br>
when the word "gain" just means the real world definition of "increase," or<br>
for the purposes of the game does it always refer to this game-term of<br>
"energy gain?"<br>
<br>
RT - While Big Chill is in effect, Creatures cannot gain energy past their<br>
starting energy. Since energizing is not considered gaining energy, a<br>
Rabbage (for instance) can energize up past 3.<br>
<br>
Second<br>
When energy removal is being altered in some way by another card in play,<br>
what is being "affected?" Is it the source, the target or does it depend on<br>
the circumstances?<br>
Here is why I ask. I have a Rock Hyren in play. His "Invulnerability"<br>
not only protects him from attacks, but also from spells, powers and<br>
effects. My Rock Hyren smooshes a Tar Hyren. Tar Hyren then promptly gooks<br>
his way all over my Rock Hyren. Tar Hyren states that "when attached, Tar<br>
Hyren is not affected by any cards." Does the one energy that my Rock Hyren<br>
loses, at the beginning of each turn, get prevented by the Invulnerability<br>
or no?<br>
<br>
RT - The energy loss itself is being affected, neither the source of the<br>
energy discard, or the victim of it; Invulnerability will prevent the Tar<br>
Hyren's energy discard. Since Tar Hyren is not affected by any cards, it<br>
cannot be shockwaved, beam of lighted, or undreamed, for examples.<br>

2. If Player A has just played a Storm of Fishes "and has called<br>
Spells". Player B has in his hand both a Moob Ring and an Abraxin's<br>
Crown. Under this situation could Player B first throw out the<br>
Abraxin's Crown and then the Moob Ring in response to Player A's<br>
attempt at discarding cards?<br>
<br>
<br>
Plus could you clarify your answer from before. I ask this<br>
considering Abraxin's Crown does not prevent discard where as the<br>
Moob Ring prevents all discard until your current magi is defeated.<br>
I'm also trying to figure out the timing issues involved in this<br>
situation. The main goal I'm trying to get at is if I can first<br>
respond to a player discarding cards from my hand with the Abraxin's<br>
Crown to force them to discard their hand/energy and then protect the<br>
rest of my cards that are subject to the discard by using Moob Ring.<br>
<br>
RT - When you are forced to discard your cards from hand, you can choose to<br>
discard the Crown or the Moob Ring instead of all of the cards you are about<br>
to discard. Once you have discarded one, you aren't about to discard any<br>
more cards, so you can't discard the other.<br>
<br>
Then there's the issue of what you said in your ruling. For one you<br>
didn't say how many relics the player with the Abraxin's Crown and<br>
Moob Ring in their hand. I assume you meant they had four relics,<br>
which included the Abraxin's Crown and Moob Ring. Also could you<br>
explain why as you said, "the Moob Ring's anti-discard effect will<br>
not save the rest of your Relics in hand" when the Moob Ring states<br>
otherwise?<br>
<br>
RT - Crown and Moob Ring both say 'when you are forced to discard one or<br>
more cards from your hand, you may discard <this card> instead.' So, instead<br>
of discarding any cards to the discard effect, you discard just the Crown or<br>
just the Moob Ring. This is a reversal of last week's ruling, based on a<br>
more thorough reading of the cards. Sorry for the confusion.<br>
<br>
Final thing...<br>
On both cards, does the word "instead" mean you can throw out say the<br>
Abraxin's Crown to save only one card that is being discarded from<br>
your hand or does the word "instead" mean it completely negates the<br>
Spell, Power, or Effect that is discarding one or more of your cards<br>
from your hand?<br>
<br>
RT - See above; they can be sacrificed to save all the other affected cards.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
-----------------------------------------<br>
shen_dugan asks again:<br>
<br>
My question is this. Player A attempts to Brushfire Player B's<br>
Wellisk using a Brushfire from his discard pile. Player B using a<br>
Phrup cancels the Brushfire. At this point the energy cost of playing<br>
the Brushfire goes back on Player A's magi, however does the<br>
Brushfire in the discard pile go back to Player A's hand?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, they would place the Brushfire back into their hand, even if<br>
played from the discard pile; this would be true with any card played from<br>
an out of play area besides the opposing hand, as Time Lapse lacks the<br>
"plays a card from their hand" clause.<br>

8. I like the card loaded dice, but I have a question about when this card<br>
can be used.<br>
"Effect - Cheating: Whenever any card requires you to roll a die, you may<br>
discard one energy from your Magi to roll two dice and choose which number<br>
to use."<br>
Here is why I ask: When I use a Cragnok or a Greater Vaal, can I use<br>
this at all? If I can, can I discard two energy from my Magi to roll four<br>
dice and choose the two I want? Perhaps I am getting hung up on words, but<br>
I was not sure if I could use it with things that already roll two dice.<br>
The "....to roll a die" and "....to roll two dice" parts make it seem like<br>
this only works when you roll a single die. Just wanted to check on this<br>
before I decide if this is going in a couple decks I have.<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, you may, but you have to pay one energy per single die you wish to<br>
'split' into two rolls, and you must roll each pair separately, not just<br>
roll all four and take the best two (in case both your first two or both the<br>
last two were the best, for instance).<br>

10. Ok, on the heels of the "you can Phrup a Climbing Staff" ruling,<br>
here's another question along those lines. Since discarding from the<br>
hand is still considered "playing", does that mean that when Tuku<br>
uses his ability so that magi cannot "play" non-universal relics,<br>
does that mean they can't discard them from their hand either, since<br>
that IS considered "playing" the card? I would be curious to know<br>
how this relates to both Climbing Staff, which has the word Effect in<br>
its anti-discard text, and how it relates to things like Abraxin's<br>
Crown, which have just card text.<br>
<br>
RT - The crux of the ruling in question is this: Any Effect that emulates<br>
playing a card (either putting it into play [Creature/Relic], or processing<br>
actions on a card in your hand and then discarding that card [Spell] is<br>
considered to be 'playing the card'. Any Game text that does this is not<br>
considered playing the card, since rules text has always been above and<br>
beyond the reach of normal card interactions. In this case, since Tuku<br>
prevents you from playing non-Universal Relics, you could not use a CS while<br>
restrain were in effect, though you could use a Crown.<br>

<br>
What takes precedence? Do you have to be able to use Crush to get the<br>
benefit of no cards affecting it, or does the fact that no cards can affect<br>
it allow it to be played after Will of Orothe targets you?<br>
<br>
RT - The key phrase in Crush is "when it is used". If it can't be used (such<br>
as when it is Locked Down), then its self-protection cannot help it. Will of<br>
Orothe will stop it without problem.<br>

"... discarded from play by an opposing card..."<br>

Do attacks that defeat a creature count as a discard? e.g. Player A's<br>

treat these cards as instead saying "discarded while it has energy".<br>
<br>
Being directly discarded by a discard effect (such as Shockwave) or being<br>
discarded from play as a result of losing all energy from an opposing card<br>

Rules Team - Official Clarification<br>
<br>
There has been recent controversy over the Kybar's Teeth Relic, Climbing<br>
staff, and a ruling made on it at the Magi-Nation DUEL Worlds tournament. We<br>
would like to clarify fully the implications of the ruling, to put this<br>
matter to rest.<br>
<br>
The act of playing a card is defined thusly:<br>
For Relics and Creatures: The act of moving a card from an out-of-play area<br>
(usually your hand) into play.<br>
For Spells: The act of removing the card from your hand, processing its<br>
actions, then discarding it (unless one of the Spell's actions places the<br>
Spell in play).<br>
Additionally, any Power or Effect on any card that emulates one of the above<br>
(like Bog Wellisk's Dream Draft or Tomes of the Great Library's Research) is<br>
considered to be 'playing' the affected card.<br>
<br>
The Regional Restrictions on playing Relics from outside of your Magi's<br>
Region have always pertained only to playing that Relic (putting it into<br>
play). Any Magi can use any Power or Effect on any Relic; otherwise Quilla<br>
could not use a Hubdra's Cubed Boomstick.<br>
<br>
When the unnamed Effect of Climbing Staff is used, it triggers all Effects<br>
and abides by all other rules pertaining to playing Relics. Since it is not<br>
being put into play, however, anyone can play it.<br>
<br>
For absolute clarity, (and hopefully to avoid further questions): Any Magi<br>
may use the unnamed Effect of Climbing Staff to discard it from their hand<br>
and protect their Magi or hand.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>

Rules Team - Special Rulings clarifications:<br>
<br>
In an effort to maintain proper text templating rules, the following changes<br>
go into effect immediately:<br>
<br>
Greater Gargagnor (Nightmare's Dawn) and Spectral Shield (Awakening) should<br>
read 'opposing Spell, Power or Effect' rather than 'opposing card'.<br>
<br>
All of the 'Undream' cards that were erratad in July (Motash's Staff,<br>
Updraft, Alaban Gloves, Mushroom Hyren, Gruk) should reference printed<br>
starting energy.<br>

times my creature attacks? along the same thread, if i have a yajo in<br>
play and use its power, does the creature who attacked twice get 6<br>
energy?<br>
<br>
RT - The additional energy discard of Roar applies only to the next attack<br>
made; the second attack from Fear will not grant any additional bonuses. As<br>
for the Yajo's Power, it does not give three energy per attack made, it adds<br>
three energy based on the condition of the chosen Creature having attacked<br>
that turn being true...So Fear will not affect this energy gain.<br>

<br>
If your opponent discards one of your Relics from play, you may have<br>
Relic Mirror discarded from play in it's place.<br>
<br>
Doesn't this imply that your relic has already been discarded? "If<br>
your opponent discards one of your relics in play". Sounds like<br>
after the discard to me. If it was meant to be pre-emptive, it would<br>
read "If your opponent WOULD discard one of your relics from play".<br>
<br>
<br>
>>Q) If I have a RM and at least one other Universal Relic (or maybe<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
>From what I remember of past rulings, this is untrue. I remember the<br>
<br>
last time it was brought up whether or not a Relic Mirror could save<br>
(say) a Rayje's Belt if both had been Beam of Light'ed. The answer<br>
given had been "no", since both were hit with the spell, Relic Mirror<br>
is no longer around to use it's effect when "your opponent discards<br>
one of your relics in play."<br>
<br>
I know that Relic Mirror is supposedly slotted for a pre-emptive<br>
wording when Second Order comes out, but I was unaware that it had<br>
been changed to pre-emptive as of right now. Makes the whole Barqua's<br>
Bubble/Vault combo even more protected.<br>
<br>
RT - Relic Mirror's wording is very unwieldy, and will be corrected if the<br>
card is reprinted. Until then, treat Trick Image as the following, which was<br>
design intent:<br>
<br>
"Effect - Trick Image: As an opposing Spell or Power that discards Relics<br>
from play would affect one of your other Relics in play, choose one of those<br>
Relics and discard Relic Mirror from play. The Spell or Power does not<br>
affect the chosen Relic."<br>
<br>
This matches the intent of Relic Mirror, which was to save Relics from even<br>
global destruction, whereas the current wording technically cannot.<br>
<br>
One final note regarding "treat as" rulings in the rules digests; these are<br>
not the same as errata, and do not appear on MRP lists. This is because<br>
these wordings are clarifications and, unlike MRPs, rarely alter the<br>
mechanical functionality of the card's intent (basically, most people play<br>
with these cards as the clarified wordings state anyway, but there are a few<br>
especially particular rules lawyers that try to loophole the intent).<br>

an amount of energy equal to its current energy, or does the Leaf Hyren<br>
actually have to lose energy in order for its power to work?<br>

have to be a kybar's teeth creature and a non kybar's teeth creature<br>
in play? also, if there are less creatures in play than whatever<br>
number you roll for ballistic baldar's effect, what happenes?<br>
<br>
RT - In the case of Jagged Rocks, only the individual effects with no<br>
Creature to affect will fizzle; you can get the benefit of the Kybar's Teeth<br>
healing even without something non-Kybar's Teeth to discard from.<br>
<br>
However, with Ballistic Baldar, it is much different; unlike Jagged Rocks,<br>
which has two different actions as part of its effect, with the Baldar, you<br>
have one action that is repeated X times and must have X targets to even<br>
work. Rolled higher than the Creatures in play? The Effect fizzles with no<br>
effect. Rolled a four, but you have three Creatures and the opponent has<br>
two? Then two of your Creatures will suffer as well.<br>

7. Can I use Climbing Staff to stop a Spirit Drain spell? Climbing Staff<br>
says<br>
whenever an opposing spell, power or effect is affecting only your magi or<br>
only your hand.<br>
<br>
Spirit Drain says "Discard energy from the choose player's Magi equal to the<br>
number of cards in that player's hand."<br>
<br>
Does counting the cards in my hand count as "affecting my hand"?<br>
<br>
Similarly, can it stop a Dark Ayebaw, since the player of the Ayebaw is<br>
affecting *his* hand by discarding cards when he pops the Ayebaw?<br>
<br>
RT - Spirit Drain, while checking the opponent's hand for the number of<br>
cards, does not actually interact with it, so Climbing Staff may prevent it.<br>
<br>
As for Dark Ayebaw's Implosion, (and, incidentally, the Spell Implosion as<br>
well) the cards discarded are listed as part of the cost for the Power.<br>
Generally, any time a card has its player discard cards and/or energy from<br>
hand/play before the cards chosen by the card are affected, these actions<br>
are considered to be part of the cost of playing a card.<br>
<br>
To head off future questions, Impact differs from this model since the<br>
Creature is discarded from play as the last action of the card.<br>

<br>
So, even if the one card they have is not to be discarded it counts as<br>
affecting their hand? If they have no cards in hand why doesn't it work? If<br>
having no cards in hand is not affected by abilities that refer to the hand,<br>
can you use Gremble with no cards in your hand? By the above ruling I <br>
would say no, which is of course silly. I think it would make more sense to<br>
flat out say Storm of Fishes can't be prevented by Climbing Staff, or that a<br>
hand is not affected unless cards are discarded. <br>
<br>
RT - A hand may only be affected if it is actually interacted with; if there<br>
are no cards in the hand, then there's no hand to interact with, and so a<br>
card like Storm of Fishes does not affect that hand. In Gremble's case,<br>
discarding your hand is a cost. If you have no hand to discard, you cannot<br>
pay the cost of discarding your hand. <br>

2. Ok, based on last week's ruling, counting the number of cards is not <br>
affecting a hand, but looking at the cards and doing nothing to them is? <br>
<br>
What exactly are all the things that count as "affecting a hand"? As I see <br>
it, right now in the game, I can: <br>
<br>
Count the cards in your hand <br>
Look at the cards in your hand <br>
Make you discard a card from your hand <br>
Make you draw a card and put it in your hand <br>
<br>
Which of these 4 things counts as "affecting"? <br>
<br>
RT - To expand on the previous definition of "affecting a hand" with an<br>
overall definition of affecting an out of play area (hand, deck, or discard<br>
pile), you only affect the area when you either A - gain previously unknown<br>
knowledge about it (revealing the hand or cards from the deck) or B - change<br>
the contents of the area (move cards from the discard pile, hand, or deck,<br>
to <br>
a new area, into or out of play). <br>
<br>
Basically put, counting the cards in hand does not affect it, because hand<br>
size is public knowledge; most people ask the opponent how many cards are in<br>
their hand, but, technically speaking, you could count it for yourself and<br>
then calculate the energy loss for a Spirit Drain, etc. - RT <br>
<br>
I also think future cards should be written with the "cost" seperate from<br>
the "effect" of a a power. This ruling that impact discarding a creature is<br>
not a cost, but dark ayebaw is a cost strikes me as a tad bit arbitrary. <br>
<br>
RT - With regards to cost...This is a templating issue we will address.<br>
However, the difference, for now, is generally apparent: when you have to<br>
lose something you own or control before you get an effect from the Power or<br>
Spell, it's a cost. This is why, whereas Implosion's card discard is a cost,<br>
Impact's Creature discard is not, because the discard happens after you've <br>
started carrying out other, potentially beneficial, effects of the Spell. <br>
<br>
Spells and Powers as a norm have their effects happen sequentially; when you<br>
have to lose something before the Spell or Power has an effect, it's a cost,<br>
if it happens afterwards, its part of the Spell effect (and some resistances<br>
may apply). - RT <br>
<br>
I understand the need for a card like climbing staff, but right now it is <br>
the worst written card in the game. How is a new player supposed to <br>
understand how it works without reading 3 megs worth of rulings, counter <br>
rules and discussion? I feel like 2i saw a need for a card that did what <br>
the unnamed effect did, and then shoehorned climbing staff to be that, <br>
rather than making it a simple little universal relic that said, "play and <br>
discard climbing staff to counter...." <br>
<br>
RT - There are three tiers of Magi-Nation play: Beginner, Advanced, and<br>
Competitive. We address Competitive specifically (with occassional rulings<br>
for the sake of the little expanded multiplay), as it applies only to<br>
Magi-Nation: DUEL sanctioned play. Because of this, we have rules that vary,<br>
sometimes greatly, from the rulebook-it's not that we do not use the<br>
rulebook <br>
as a starting ground, it's that so few cards work outside the rules laid out<br>
in the rulebook that to address tham all there would overcomplicate the<br>
learning of the game. The rules digest guidelines are not a necessity for<br>
most players or most games...The rules team is more of a means of handling<br>
the problems that arise when players take technicalities too literally or<br>
just literally enough to use to their own advantage. <br>
<br>
The difficulty in adjudicating rules lawyering is that it's such a broad<br>
area; some things, if taken literally, are wholly unbalancing, but sometimes<br>
not taking them verbatim opens the door for gross generalizations that open<br>
the door even further. This is why we have a constantly changing rules<br>
environment, competitively, and why we have had to rebuild out card text<br>
templating guidelines with each set. To be blunt, if players would take<br>
their most common advice, "keep it simple", and not try to force us into a<br>
corner by lawyering, a lot of rulings difficulties would not arise. However,<br>
many players feel part of the competition is "outsmarting" the rules over<br>
playing the game, and so we make seemingly counter-intuitive rulings to<br>
counter-balance that. <br>
<br>
Climbing Staff was never intended to be an unstoppable shield; it breaks the<br>
rhythm of the game in a poor direction to do so. One of the appealing<br>
factors has always been, once it's your turn, you know what can and cannot<br>
happen-the worst the opponent could do is use what Effects they have on<br>
their side of the table, but, as long as you planned your attack<br>
accordingly, you could <br>
guarantee a fair level of success. And within that measure also ran the risk<br>
of having to play intelligently and not be committed in such a way so as to<br>
let the opponent have such a guaranteed chance. Some regions (namely<br>
Paradwyn) occassionally break this mold, but that is in the spirit of what<br>
they were intended to do. <br>
<br>
Climbing Staff, if unstoppable, has the potential to lower the playing<br>
quality of the competitive environment. With such effective countermeasures<br>
available, a player can commit himself much more recklessly with a "safety<br>
net" and not worry about the consequences. And as for the "victim" of the<br>
Staff, it can be needlessly frustrating when it is the only factor stopping <br>
you from a precisely calculated win. While it is a factor that could be<br>
accounted for, if you know it's a possibility, there should still be a means<br>
of stopping it. <br>
<br>
The playing cards ruleset, however, has been changed, to a degree. The<br>
easiest definition of playing a card is now defined as a player actively<br>
choosing to remove a card from an out of play area to generate an effect<br>
(not necessarily Effect) defined on the removed card that directly affects<br>
the game. <br>
<br>
This does not apply to "discard hosers" such as Abraxin's Crown because<br>
those cards use Rules Text, not a Power, Spell, or Effect when they are<br>
played. Additionally, this does not apply to cards discarded for other costs<br>
either, as such discards do not generate effects on the cards discarded. <br>
<br>
The only cards that absolutely cannot be played without reminder text or<br>
other abilities (Mantle of Shadows being an example) are Core Spells by<br>
non-Core Magi, and non-Core, non-Universal Spells by Core Magi. Any other<br>
card may be played by any Magi, as long as actively putting the card into<br>
play does not violate regional restrictions. Cards that are put into play<br>
are mostly Creatures and Relics, and usually cannot be played because of<br>
regional restrictions. The exception is if a non-Spell card is played from<br>
hand and will not end up in play, but in an out of play area (usually the<br>
discard pile). When this happens, the Magi will not be violating their<br>
regional restriction on putting the card into play, and so they may play it<br>
freely. <br>

4. Well, we have some discussion with this creatures last time we play <br>
at the League. Chogus, Gratch and Perpetual Motions really give <br>
headaches. <br>
<br>
Chogus <br>
Effect - Exuberance: All of your cards that check for the largest <br>
opposing creature in play instead check for the smallest opposing <br>
creature in play, and all of your cards that check for the smallest <br>
opposing creature in play instead check for the largest opposing <br>
creature in play. <br>
<br>
Gratch <br>
Effect - Hunting Howl: At the beginning of your turn, if your <br>
smallest creature in play larger than the largest opposing creature <br>
in play add one energy to each of your other Kybar Teeth's creatures <br>
in play. <br>
<br>
First the player that was using Kybar says that if I have no <br>
creatures in play and he has a Gratch and any other Kybar creature, <br>
those other Kybar creatures will gain one energy, since his smallest <br>
creature will be larger than a non existence creature. I said to him <br>
that there is no creature to compare with so they effect will not <br>
activate. Who is correct? <br>
<br>
RT - If there is no Creature to make the comparison with, the Effect fizzles<br>
and does nothing. <br>
<br>
Second If I have more that one Chogus in play. Will all there effects <br>
will be activated or they will overlap? <br>
<br>
RT - Unless noted otherwise in the Effect, all redundant Effects will occur<br>
simultaneously when their conditions are met. <br>
<br>
Ex. A: I have 2 Chogus in play. So the first one will change the <br>
smallest for largest and largest to smallest, but the second one will <br>
do nothing since they overlap. <br>
<br>
RT - They would, effectively, overlap; they both do the exact same thing,<br>
and it's a 'static' change, so you would essentially get no benefit from<br>
extra Choguses in play. <br>

5. This is just a question of in game mechanics: <br>
<br>
When a card is played that checks for other cards in play, does it also<br>
check <br>
itself if it meets the requirements to trigger its own power or effect? I'm <br>
going to reference the ruling on the alpine xamf a while ago in saying that <br>
it doesn't, but I would like it completely cleared up for later tournaments.<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Depends on how it is phrased; in Alpine Xamf's example, the Effect has<br>
to be active before it can happen, and if the Xamf is not in play, the<br>
Effect isn't active. Other Effects, such as Flame Trulb, check once the<br>
Creature has actually entered play; those Effects count the Creature. It is<br>
very specific on the phrasing, but those two Effects can be used as rough<br>
guidelines. <br>

<br>
game, for example) what heppens to the spell effect? Does it cease to exist <br>
in much the same way that spells on table (like Dream Channel) do? Or does<br>
it <br>
continue to operate similar to creature powers (like Tree Hinko's Invigorate<br>
<br>
power)? <br>
<br>
RT - Such ongoing Spell effects last until they have expired, either by<br>
doing what they are supposed to do (Deadfalling two Creatures) or their<br>
duration has expired (the end of the chosen player's next turn, as is Will<br>
of Orothe's case). Focus is a special case; while it will not increase the<br>
energize rate of your next Magi if the one that played it is defeated, your<br>
next Magi will <br>
still be unable to play cards until the end of your turn after Focus was<br>
played (the biggest risk of all with the Spell). <br>

10. could you please tell me why ullig was mrp'd he way she was? the <br>
reason i ask is because 1. i could find only one way she could be <br>
broken and 2 the new mrp (to me) makes her almost useless, due to her <br>
low energize rate and her very conditional power. i saw in a previous <br>
rules digest that there was a fear that ullig could use kybar's echo <br>
and a quido swarm (that bograth/paradwyn "x energy" creature) for an <br>
infinate energy loop, but that concern is actually uneccisary, due to <br>
the fact that moss quido is not kybar's teeth. the only way the loop <br>
could occur is if kybar's echo was quilled to read bograth or <br>
paradwyn, and how often does a KT magi get an arderial relic? =) i <br>
respect the RT's efforts to create a fairgame, but unless ullig is <br>
broken in some other way, especially with the mrp on kybar's echo <br>
(which i support), then i ask that you please change her back. =) <br>
<br>
RT - Ullig is far from useless; the conditions of her Effect are still very<br>
easy to fulfill, because it is triggered any time an opposing card forces<br>
your final Creature to be discarded from play, either by directly discarding<br>
it, or reducing it to zero energy (in attacks, opposing Spells, etc). <br>

11. i had another question, this time regarding the fun ol' <br>
cataclysm. if the intent of the card is, as it's been ruled before, <br>
that cataclysm directly targets everything that it discards (thus <br>
allowing cards like umm...no and effects like anti-magic to be <br>
triggered), so why hasn't it been mrp'd to read "discards all <br>
creatures, speels, and relics in play"? <br>
<br>
RT - Such non-functional MRPs create unnecessary confusion; additionally,<br>
the phrase "if specific discarded" no longer exists, and all instances of it<br>
should be replaced with "if discarded while it has energy". While this issue<br>
will be handled when the card is reprinted, it's not needed now. <br>

12. I have a question reguarding staff of keepers. If I have, say, an <br>
Arderial-Orothe Deck, and My First Magi is M'Rika, and by second is <br>
Delia, what would happen if I played a Staff of Keepers and named <br>
Arderial, and then later, while Staff of Keepers was still in play, <br>
used M'Rika's Interchange to bring up Delia. does Delia, a keeper, <br>
get Staff of keepers effect when she plays arderial cards? <br>
<br>
RT - Staff of Keepers only requires that you not name the region of your<br>
Magi when it is first played; if you later Interchange to the Magi that is<br>
of the region named, then you get the benefits of it. Delia's Arderial<br>
Creatures would gain energy when played, in this case. Interchanging your<br>
Magi does not force you to make new decisions for your Relics to make them<br>
'legal', the <br>
Relics only needed the decision to be legal when the choice was initially<br>
made. <br>

13. ok, question, can one play crushing heat, blast glove it, then crown <br>

<br>
RT - No; when you first play a Spell, you must make all choices for it, <br>
including what it will affect, meaning that it must initially be chosen to <br>
affect the Magi and, if so, would not be valid for Blast gloves. <br>

14. There has been some discussion about Lovian and cards that can/cannot <br>
work with him. I have a few questions that have come up from this <br>
debate. <br>
<br>
A)If a card A cannot be affected by card B, can card B even choose to <br>
target card A even though card A won't be affected? Ex. Lovian vs. <br>
Lava Flow, Lovian vs. Impact. <br>
<br>
RT - In the first example, Lava Flow CAN affect the Lovian, as far as <br>
discarding energy, so the Lovian may be chosen. In the second example, the <br>
Impact can do absolutely nothing to the Lovian, so the Lovian canot be <br>
chosen. In summation, only if the Spell or Power can do absolutely nothing<br>
to <br>
the unaffected card, then it cannot be chosen. <br>
<br>
B)If a card does not require the first part of the action to be done, <br>
to perform the second part of the action, i.e. Tap Roots, do you <br>
process as many (lower case e) effects of the card as you can? <br>
<br>
RT - You may process any effects that are not dependent on other <br>
effects/requirements named on the card; in the Tap Roots example, neither <br>
action is dependent on the other (adding energy or discarding energy), but <br>
the requirement of choosing two different Creatures must be met. <br>

15. A. if a creature must attack(jungertrug) and i play will of orothe <br>
on that creature, then can i choose for him not to attack? <br>
<br>
RT - If a Creature must attack, then you must make it attack with Will of<br>
Orothe, though you make all attack decisions as normal. <br>
<br>
B. if a magi plays will of orothe or something that allows you to do <br>
something on that PLAYERS next turn and that magi is defeated before the <br>
players next turn then can they still carry out will of orothe? <br>
<br>
RT - Will of Orothe affects a player, then their Creatures (so that if a<br>
player plays new Creatures, they're still affected) until the end of its<br>
duration; if you defeat the Magi, then the new Magi will still suffer the<br>
effects. <br>
<br>
C. if i play a creature(greenstuff) and the magi ogar then wich <br>
effect happens first, would ogar get to roll or would i add one to <br>
green stuff? so in essence what is the order of effects that are <br>
triggered by one thing?do i get my effects first if there are more <br>
than one or do we alternate starting with mine....and what happens if <br>
by me playing a creature triggers 2 effects for player A(me), 1 for <br>
player B(wellisk), and 1 for player C(ogar) and one for player D <br>
(wudge). and the order of normal turns if ABCD, what would be the <br>
order of effects? <br>
<br>
RT - The active player gets to resolve all of their effects first, in the<br>
order they choose, then the next in player order gets to do the same, until<br>
all effects are resolved; because you played the Green Stuff, it would get<br>
its energy, then Ogar would get to use Feral Instinct. As for multiplayer, A<br>
would choose the order that all of your simultaneous effects resolve,<br>
resolve <br>
them, then so would B, C, then D. If it was B's turn, it would be B, C, D,<br>
then A, etc. <br>
<br>
D. can i play tuk berries(weave) on a creature that can't attack? or <br>
must the creature be a creature that can attack before it can be <br>
targeted. <br>
<br>
RT - You may use Nourish on a Creature that normally could not attack. <br>
<br>
E. with the quido swarm's effect, swarm. if i have 10 creatures <br>
when i play him, and someone defeats all creatures but him left with 6 <br>
energy, then at the beggining of my turn does he reduce to 1 energy. <br>
to me i wouldn't think so because his text says restore, and doesnt' <br>
restore mean to go up not down? <br>
<br>
RT - The Quido Swarm will change its current energy back to its starting<br>
energy at the beginning of the turn, and if there are no other Creatures in<br>
play, that will be zero; the Creature is then defeated. <br>
<br>
F. what if I play a burrow spell on a creature that has the effect <br>
invulnerability? would he lose no energy in attacks or would he only <br>
lose two still? if so, then which effect comes first and how do you <br>
know which effects would trigger first if they are supposed to <br>
trigger simultaneously? <br>
<br>
RT - See ruling #6 in this digest. <br>
<br>
G. can effects on creatures only be used once per turn or multiple <br>
times during one turn? <br>
<br>
RT - Unless the Effect states otherwise, it may be used as many times as its<br>
conditions are met. <br>

1. Climbing Staff (One More Time).<br>
<br>
After much deliberation over the subject, we have decided to reverse the<br>
most recent rulings regarding Climbing Staff and playing of cards. Though<br>
the rulings did maintain both card intent and play balance, card intent<br>
cannot always be used alone to alter precedence contradictory to wording, or<br>
to even restructure the rules as needed. Such changes can be saved for our<br>
next major rules revision, Second Order. Until then, the procedure for using<br>
the Effect on Climbing Staff is as follows:<br>
<br>
-Anyone can use the unnamed Effect on Climbing Staff.<br>
-Using that Effect is not considered playing the card.<br>
-Since you aren't playing CS with the effect, no effects or other actions<br>
that trigger on Relics being played occur.<br>
<br>
Now, back to your regularly scheduled program...As a side note, the ruling<br>
was valid at the time it was made and has been for the past few weeks, so<br>
please don't try to ruin your director's reputation by attempting appeals<br>
based on it, because such appeals will be thrown out and just waste the time<br>
of everyone involved.<br>

2. if Zajan goes first does he energize at the end of the turn or does<br>
he just get to draw cards at the beginning, or does he not draw two<br>
cards and energizes at the end, or is it that he gets to do both.<br>
<br>
RT - Regardless of when it happens during the first turn of the game, the<br>
first time that player's Magi should energize, they do not energize as<br>
normal. If the energize is somehow shifted to somewhere aside from the<br>
Energize step and another energize effect happens (Flood of Energy), then<br>
that energize effect for that Magi will be the one 'cancelled' by the rule,<br>
but then the energize would happen normally later that turn. Zajan still has<br>
his energize step, so he would draw two cards, but by the rules, he would<br>
not normally energize during the draw step if he went first the very first<br>
turn of the game. If he played Flood of Energy during his turn, however,<br>
though he'd gain no energy then, he would gain energy during the Draw step.<br>

(under normal circumstances) are discarded as well; this holds true with<br>
Illusions, and they will be discarded by Magi defeat.<br>

4. Can All-High King Korg use the Effect on Climbing Staff? I had<br>
previously thought so, but then I saw the ruling that using the Effect<br>
counts as "playing" the relic.<br>
<br>
RT - See this week's reversal; under the old ruling, Korg couldn't, but,<br>
seems he figured out how to in the last week (took him long enough; there<br>
are no moving parts, after all).<br>
<br>
Also, can you use a Climbing Staff in response to Emaal's Effect? She<br>
affects your Magi with it, but also draws a card. I'm not sure if the<br>
card drawing gets around the CS restriction.<br>
<br>
RT - Emaal's Effect affects both her player's hand and the opposing Magi;<br>
Climbing Staff cannot stop it.<br>

because my english is not very good.<br>
<br>
I have understand that a spell that discard energy, say a Fireball for<br>
example, can target the Lovian. Am I wrong ??<br>
<br>
RT - No, it can't; only if the Fireball would discard energy (such as if a<br>
Rayje's Sword were in play), it could. Lava Flow is an exception because it<br>
has Piercing (Rayje's Sword Effect) basically built in.<br>
<br>
And I have another question, concerning Furok :<br>
If a 4-energy Furok attack a 20-energy creature, how many energy can I<br>
retrieve.<br>
<br>
RT - The Furok would Retrieve two energy in the example given; half of<br>
what it discarded, rounded down.<br>

6. Can you play Empress Gia in a deck with "regular" Gia?<br>
<br>
The argumment:<br>
<br>
Barak and Barak the Red cannot be played together, even though Barak<br>
the Red does not say Alternate Barak. Yet Lady of the Sky and<br>
Defender of the Sky CAN be played together EVEN THOUGH *not meaning<br>
to yell, just stressing words* both of their names contain OF THE SKY.<br>
<br>
So what is it? Can Defender and Lady of the Sky not be played<br>
together? Or can Empress Gia and Gia be played together?<br>
<br>
RT - Magi do not follow the same naming conventions as Creatures; only if<br>
the Magi shares a proper name (as a single word) as an existing Magi is it<br>
an alternate. "of the Sky" or even "Sky" is not a proper name, because there<br>
is no Magi in existance named Sky (and that would be a bit bland for a<br>
Magi-Nation name anyway). Barak the Red is Alternate Barak because Barak<br>
exists, Evil Evu is Alternate Evu, and Poad, Innkeeper will be Alternate<br>
Poad without needing the tagline either. So, yes, you may play the Lady and<br>
Defender together.<br>
<br>
Empress Gia is an Alternate Gia because Gia exists as a Magi, and is an<br>
Alternate Nagsis because he/she says so in his/her card type.<br>

7. Hello [Rules] people:<br>
A: Poor Tuku was MRP'd to state that "You cannot use Restrain on your next<br>
turn." However, if I have a relic mirror or Rayje's Construct in play, I<br>
am<br>
not using "restrain", I am using "aura-reflection'. So what's the rule on<br>
this, because I have already received some whines on this (but no<br>
cheese!).<br>
<br>
RT - Whenever you are not allowed to use a Power, this applies to copies<br>
of that Power as well. You may not use Auraflection to copy a restricted<br>
Power (just as you cannot Sorreah's Dream a Shadow Cloak two turns in a<br>
row).<br>
<br>
B: Corrupt is played and attached to the Dark Twins (and of course they<br>
always go first, the little creeps). I play a Lovian. There was a small<br>
debate that Lovian's effect is not "in effect" until he's in play;<br>
however,<br>
on this note, if Lovian can be corrupted in this matter then all the<br>
non-core<br>
creatures could as well (ex: Hunter Jile, Flugg, etc.). The debate stemmed<br>
from a ruling made on Vine Hyren earlier; because V.H. cannot gain an<br>
energy<br>
for playing and dreamwarping itself.<br>
<br>
RT - The Lovian will Resist the Corrupt just as well as any Core-Resistant<br>
Creature, and it will be discarded with no effect.<br>
<br>
C: You just ruled that Lava Flow sets precedence over Lovian's effect.<br>
This<br>
makes Lava Flow pretty powerful for only 2 energy with things like blast<br>
gloves, scrolls of fire and abraxin's crown. Does Lava Flow go through<br>
burrow? If opposing cards cannot stop Lava Flow, then you should not be<br>
able<br>
to alter the amount of energy removed from Lava Flow, i.e. increase it.<br>
<br>
RT - Lava Flow is literally unstoppable energy discard, just like any<br>
discard with Piercing in Effect. Also, just like Piercing stopping Burrow<br>
from reducing energy loss, laval flows into those little burrows quite<br>
effectively (so Lava Flow discards energy from opposing Burrowed Creatures,<br>
ignoring Burrow, unless you happened to be the one that Burrowed the<br>
opposing Creature).<br>

play cannot gain energy above their starting energy.does this mean if<br>
i have a creatue in play with more then its starting does it have to<br>
loss all energy above its starting?<br>
<br>
RT - When Big Chill goes into Effect, any Creatures above their starting<br>
energy stay there. Big Chill doesn't "do" anything until energy is added; if<br>
the energy addition would raise the Creature above its starting energy, then<br>
no more energy is added once the Creature reaches its starting. If the<br>
Creature is already at its starting or higher, then the energy adding effect<br>
simply adds nothing to the Creature.<br>

forces that energy to be discarded, or does the<br>
donation never take place?<br>
<br>
RT - The first half of the Move effect will occur (discard all but one<br>
energy from your Magi) when the Magi energizes, but the second half (add<br>
that much energy) will be restricted by Big Chill, so that if the energy add<br>
would raise the energy on Pyder above its starting, then no energy above its<br>
starting will be added (essentially making the energy lost).<br>

your<br>
hand to use Gremble's power then how are you able to use<br>
Orwin's/Barak's/Strag's Ring without any spells in your discard pile?<br>

RT - The requirement for a Gremble is a cost; the requirement for Purity<br>

<br>
Are there non-(region) Spells in your discard pile?<br>

11. I've now seen/talked about this combo at least two or three times<br>
now. The question concerning this combo is...<br>
<br>
Can the Korremar + Gia Pet card combo lock down your opponent's<br>
drawing capabilities completely? I'm of the opinion, as are others in<br>
my play group, that this isn't the case and in fact your opponent<br>
would still draw one card at the end of their turn. Am I correct in<br>
this assessment of these cards?<br>
<br>
RT - If the opponent had not drawn any cards outside of their Draw step,<br>
then they would still get to draw one card.<br>
<br>
Effectively, under the normal circumstances of drawing two cards per turn,<br>
Gia Pet and Korremar do the same thing, they just have a different way of<br>
going about it. Korremar says "Once you've drawn a card, you can draw no<br>
more this turn", while Gia Pet would say "You get to draw X-1 cards this<br>
turn, where X is the amount you normally draw". In both cases, you still get<br>
to draw that lone, first card; Korremar doesn't intercede until the player<br>
has successfully drawn a card that turn, and Gia Pet doesn't do anything<br>
until you reach your last "scheduled" card draw of that turn. So even if<br>
both are used together, the opponent would still get one card.<br>
<br>
This follows the same logic as the 'caps vs. reduction' rulings made<br>
regarding Invulnerability and Burrow. Reductions (like Gia Pet's Effect )<br>
are always applied before caps (which is what Korremar sets up).<br>
<br>
And while we're discussing it, Gia's Pet vs. League Elder is another<br>
question that needs to be answered here. League Elder specifically draws<br>
until he has five cards in his hand, meaning that he will ignore Gia Pet's<br>
draw restriction. Since Korremar allows only one card draw per turn, and<br>
Leaguer Elder will try to draw more than one card, the Elder will be<br>
'capped' by Korremar. This also means that if he would draw additional cards<br>
(Warrada's Ring, for instance), he will not get those additional cards-five,<br>
no more, no less.<br>

it's power to stop dreamburn (because it is an effect) he said that it<br>

RT - Your opponent is correct; the text of Abraxin's Crown that takes<br>
effect when it's discarded is not an Effect, but rules text, and Tomorrow's<br>
Jewel cannot stop it.<br>
<br>
In a similar instance i'm vulbor'd could i play a tomorrow's jewel<br>

<br>
RT - No; you could choose the Jewel and an additional card from your hand<br>
to discard, but the Jewel is not played until it is actually discarded from<br>
your hand, which would be too late for you to use the Jewel's anti-discard<br>
ability.<br>

ANNOUNCEMENT:<br>
<br>
Beginning with the Rules Digest for the weekend of Oct 4th, 2002, the weekly<br>
schedule will change to Monday instead of Friday.<br>
<br>
This is to help accomodate the adequate discussion and decision-making <br>
process of the members of the Rules Team, all of which will be announced in <br>
the next digest.<br>
<br>
The new team will take the rulings process in a new direction, but hopefully, <br>
a favorable one. Unlike previous incarnations of the rules team, there will <br>
be the possibility of time set aside for all members to discuss rulings <br>
together in a judicious manner on a weekly basis, and for all to have a say <br>
in the rulings, meaning no ruling will be made unless there is at least an <br>
overall agreement amongst the group, all well-versed in the rules as well as <br>
competitive play and the playtesting process. <br>
<br>
This is the largest rules team so far, comprising three members as well as <br>
the RT director, and our goal is to clearly and concisely make and explain <br>
all rulings in a satisfactory and, most importantly, intuitive manner so that <br>
players of all skill levels will be able to quickly and easily develop an <br>
advanced understanding of the game and some of the finer intricacies of its <br>
rules system.<br>
<br>
Just bear with us, and if all goes as we hope, the rules will be something <br>
undaunting to everyone, every age.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to all involved, <br>

1. What about the ruling that you <br>
need an active Magi to play CS from your hand and use its effect. <br>
Does that still hold true?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; you must have an active Magi in order to use the Effect on Climbing<br>
Staff, meaning that Crushing Heat can still stop you from using the Effect to <br>
protect yourself.<br>

2. If a Vulbor Discards 2 cards from a hand, and Abraxin's Crown And Gilded<br>
Cage are the only cards in your hand which card activates first? The<br>
cage? or Crown? Thanks!<br>
<br>
RT - You may choose the order you activate them both, most likely the Cage <br>
then the Crown, so that you are able to draw cards.<br>

3. Sneak Attack reads Until the begining of your next turn, whenever a <br>
Creature attacks or is attacked, you may choose to have either or <br>
both Creatures remove energy equal to their starting energy instead <br>
of their current energy. Energy removed in attacks cannot be reduced <br>
or prevented. Does this mean that spells/powers/effect won't work? <br>
Say a creature with borrow does the borrow not work?<br>
<br>
RT - Spells, Powers, and Effects will still work normally, as long as they do <br>
not reduce the amount of energy discarded. Burrow, since Burrow is always <br>
granted by a Spell, Power, or Effect, will not reduce the energy loss.<br>

4. Phlouk states "At the end of your turn, discard energy from Phlouk equal <br>
to the Creature's starting energy. If you don't have enough energy on <br>
Phlouk, discard the Creature from play."<br>
<br>
My question lies in what happens when the creature costs more energy than <br>
Phlouk has remaining, but Phlouk has more than zero. I was playing a game <br>
last night and my opponent Ring Tested a Creature with a starting energy of <br>
four. At the end of her turn, Phlouk had three energy left on him. Because <br>
Phlouk didn't have four, my opponent discarded the creature from play, but <br>
did not discard the three energy from Phlouk. I was confused because I took <br>
Phlouk to effectively mean "Remove energy from Phlouk equal to the starting <br>
energy of the Creature that was Ring Tested. If the energy removed was not <br>
equal to the starting energy of the Creature, it is discarded." My opponent <br>
thought Ring Testing effectively meant "... if there is not enough energy on <br>
Phlouk, discard the Creature from play instead."<br>
<br>
Which of these is correct? Or if neither are, please let me know what <br>
happens when Phlouk has some energy at the end of the turn, but not enough to <br>
cover the Ring Test's requirement.<br>
<br>
RT - The events of Ring Testing occur sequentially, as long as the Ring <br>
Tested Creature is in play; first, the energy is discarded, then, if it was <br>
not enough, the Creature is also discarded. If there is no Ring Tested <br>
Creature remaining in play, there is nothing to check against, and so you do <br>
not have to pay anything.<br>

5. If I were to play a Rajye's Boots, that would not allow other players <br>
to play creatures outside of thier own region. But what if my <br>
opponent plays a Gwaeg? Would this still allow my opponent to still <br>
play Bograth and Core still?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; due to rules regarding specificity vs. generality, just as Hrada's <br>
Tainted victims could still play cards of their region, Bograth and Core Magi <br>
could still play Bograth and Core cards.<br>
<br>

6. Ok, with the Unlim wording "Choose any one creature in play. Discard <br>
X energy from the chosen creature. Add X energy to your magi." it is <br>
clear that you can dreamburn a magi essentially for 4e. Now, looking <br>
at the demo version (which I'm told is the clarification we should go <br>
by) which says "Choose any one creature in play. Move X energy from <br>
that creature to your magi." we can see that you can still use <br>
dreamburn to discard energy from the magi, but can you gain the <br>
energy back (minus 4), like you could with the unlimited wording? An <br>
explanation either way would be helpful as well.<br>
<br>
Secondly, with spells like Ambush, Storm Cloud, Syphon Vortex, <br>
Brushfire, Thunderquake, etc. can you use Dreamburn to hit magi with <br>
these spells if there are no creatures in play?<br>
<br>
RT - The only requirement for Dreamburn is that energy be discarded from only <br>
one Creature by a Spell; since part of the move mechanic is energy discard, <br>
you could legally Dreamburn Syphon Vortex to the opposing Magi and move X <br>
energy (or all they have, whichever is less)from that Magi to yours.<br>
<br>
As for the other Spells:<br>
<br>
Ambush - Legal, and discards energy equal to the Magi's starting energy.<br>
Storm Cloud - Legal, reducing the opposing Magi to one energy.<br>
Brushfire - Legal, discarding two energy from the Magi.<br>
Thunderquake - Legal as long as you do not try to split the Quake amongst <br>
multiple Magi.<br>
<br>
Dreamburn will work with any Spell or Power that can discard energy from only <br>
one Creature or Magi, and only if the Spell or Power has one Creature or Magi<br>
to affect. For instance, if there was only one opposing Creature in play, you <br>
may Dreamburn a Fire Chogo's Power and discard energy from the opposing Magi, <br>
because the Power would discard energy from only one Creature, but in a <br>
multiplayer game you could not Dreamburn Maelstrom, even if an opponent only <br>
has one Creature, while all opposing players have a Magi active, because <br>
Maelstrom would discard energy from more than a single Magi in that case. <br>
This is not a case of Dreamburn "looking into the future", and even if all <br>
but one of the victims of a global affect cannot be affected, you cannot <br>
Dreamburn if there would be multiple targets.<br>

7. Flame trulb's ability reads "Add one energy to FT for every C or BR <br>
creature <br>
in play, which ever is less." I thought it meant that if there were no BR <br>
creatures and 3 C, that it would have 2 (3 possibly if it can check itself), <br>
my friend thought 5." What's correct?<br>
<br>
RT - The Effect does not trigger until the Trulb is in play, and so the Trulb <br>
would count itself. The Effect adds energy equal to the least number of <br>
Creatures in play, so if the were only Cald Creatures in play, it would get <br>
+1E, because it's one Bograth Creature, and the reverse would be true if all <br>
other Creatures in play were Bograth (it would give +1E since there's only <br>
one Cald Creature in play). Most likely, it will only ever get more than one <br>
energy if you have other Flame Trulbs already in play.<br>

8. Player A is playing Paradwyn and they have 4 creatures with dreamwarp <br>
in play. The players plays<br>
<br>
Radiant Spring - Paradwyn Spell<br>
<br>
Cost: 1<br>
Until the end of the turn, all Creatures with the Effect "Dreamwarp" <br>
may Dreamwarp for up to an addition five energy.<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
Liriel's Cape - Paradwyn Relic<br>
<br>
Cost: 2 <br>
Effect - Dazzle: All of your Creatures with the Effect "Dreamwarp" <br>
have an additional three starting energy while they are in play. <br>
Power - Mass Heal: Discard Liriel's Cape from play. If there is at <br>
least one opposing Creature, restore all Creatures with less than <br>
their starting energy to their starting energy.<br>
<br>
My question is, how does this resolve? The person who has played <br>
this, says that when you discard the cape, the Creatures in play with <br>
Dreamwarp receive an additional eight energy. Is this correct? <br>
<br>
RT - The Creatures would gain no energy above their starting. First, since <br>
Liriel's Cape is discarded from play before the energy is added, it's not in <br>
play to grant the +3 bonus to starting energy. Second, Radiant Spring only <br>
applies to Dreamwarping Creatures when you play them; it does not increase <br>
the starting energy of Creatures with Dreamwarp by five unless you actually <br>
played them that turn and warped them up by five.<br>

9. After an opposing creature uses a power, T'kanzam may use an 'Exact <br>
Copy' of that power, 'Paying all costs'.<br>
<br>
Now, does the 'Paying all costs' mean that T'kanzam could copy a self-<br>
referential card like Giant Parathin, which discards itself?<br>
<br>
Or, does the 'Exact Copy' bit mean that T'kanzam's power would still <br>
read 'Discard Giant Parathin to...ect..' ?<br>
<br>
RT - Whenever a card copies a Power or Effect, all self-references in the <br>
Power or Effect change to the name of the card copying it; this means that <br>
T'kanzam's Interchange would read "discard T'Kanzam from play", etc.<br>

10. so if i have emlob and no creatures in play, can i play darkness and <br>
discard three other creatures in play from emlob's text?<br>
<br>
RT - No; Imaginary Friends does not create Imaginary Creatures, it simply <br>
adds +3 to the total of Creatures or Bograth Creatures you have in play <br>
whenever one of your cards checks for the total.<br>

11. Player A has 2 tunnel hyren and orpus in play with<br>
D'Jarvish and Motash's staff.<br>
<br>
Player B plays cataclysm.<br>
<br>
Can player A use Um...No to protect orpus AND use<br>
orpus to save motash's staff?<br>
<br>
RT - Even if you did not use Um...NO!, you could discard the energy from <br>
Orpus to save the Staff from the Cataclysm; when a Creature is discarded from <br>
play, it does not lose its energy total until it actually enters an out of <br>
play area, when the rules for card memory make the Creature "forget" its old <br>
energy total.<br>
<br>
Also, there has been some controversy on the ruling regarding D'Jarvish, <br>
Motash's Staff, and burrowed/illusionary Creatures vs. Cataclysm. Some <br>
believe that the Staff would be discarded from play before the Creatures were <br>
returned and therefore no energy could be gained; here is the actual order of <br>
events in this scenario:<br>
<br>
1. Cataclysm is played and resolved, discarding all non-Magi cards from play.<br>
2. Before anything happens, all of D'Jarvish's burrowed/illusionary Creatures <br>
are changed from being discarded from play to being returned to their owner's <br>
hand.<br>
3. Everything begins to leave play, whether discarded or 'bouncing'; because <br>
Motash's Staff is still in play when the burrowed/illusionary Creatures are <br>
told to 'bounce' back to hand, its Effect is triggered and their energy <br>
totals are added to D'Jarvish (contrary to popular belief, the energy is not <br>
added when the Creature reaches the hand, but when it's scheduled to and <br>
actually begins the trip; otherwise, once it reached the hand, it would have <br>
no energy total to add back because it forgets what it was).<br>
4. The burrowed/illusionary Creatures D'Jarvish had are put into his hand at <br>
the same time the rest of the non-Magi cards in play are placed in the <br>
discard pile.<br>

12. Does Furok Guardian's Terra Rebirth save another creature if Cataclysm is <br>
<br>
played? Would Fird stone work? Could 3 Furok Guardians save each other in <br>
event of cataclysm? <br>
<br>
RT - Fird Favor triggers when Furoks are scheduled to be affected, but before <br>
they actually are; it could intercede and protect your Furoks from Cataclysm, <br>
though it would be swept away.<br>
<br>
Multiple Furok Guardians could save each other from a Cataclysm; they would <br>
be Reborn at the end of the turn at full energy once again.<br>

Gremble Grumbles<br>
<br>
The previous ruling on the hand discard of Gremble's Power being a cost is <br>
reversed, because it was accidentally mistemplated to not be stated clearly <br>
as a cost, and so you may use it with an empty hand. However, we will almost <br>
assuredly repair the problem if Gremble is reprinted.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the rulings on whether or not you can affect an out of play <br>
area without cards are upheld; whether or not the out of play area exists is <br>
irrelevant, whenever a card refers to affecting the "hand, deck, or discard <br>
pile", it refers to them as if they have cards there. If they don't, the card <br>
cannot affect it, if it were trying to actively do so (but it can still check <br>
an empty area to see if something is or is not there), because it's not <br>
trying to affect the "zone", but the cards stored in that "zone". <br>

RT Announcement - New RT Members<br>
<br>
I am pleased to announce our newest members to Magi-Nation DUEL's Rules Team. <br>
These volunteers will be assisting in the compilation of the weekly rules <br>
digests as well as other rules endeavors for the players of Magi-Nation. They <br>
are as follows:<br>
<br>
Brad "DarthVereb" Vereb<br>
Rich "Redeemer of Ogar" Riley<br>
Robert "Dr. Bob" Nicaise<br>
<br>
As stated in last week's digest, it will be this new rules team's goal to <br>
patch the rules and make them as user-friendly and intuitive as possible, and <br>
that goal begins today. If you have any concerns over 'broken' decks or <br>
unbalanced cards, then direct them to thelawofsteel@..., and we'll take <br>
every effort to investigate the matter to the best of our ability.<br>
<br>
-L. "Law" Sterling<br>
Magi-Nation DUEL Rules Team Director<br>
<br>
P.S. - If a ruling in a digest from now on reverses a ruling from either of <br>
the previous RTs, then the ruling is an official reversal and not a <br>
contradiction. RT has previously made conflicting rulings, and we are going <br>
to take the opportunity to repair these mistakes as we find them to insure <br>
that the rules are as intuitive as possible. We will also be starting work on <br>
a new MagiDuel style site, which will be your source for all the most up to <br>
date, correct rules info as it becomes available; we will not archive <br>
reversed rulings and the like, however, preferring to maintain the site as <br>
purely a reference for all of the most up to date rules regarding specific <br>
cards, mechanics, and their interactions.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
CLARIFICATIONS:<br>
<br>
Treat Amulet of Ombor as if it had the following rules text (see question <br>
twelve):<br>
<br>
Any time that you may play a Relic, as long as Amulet of Ombor is in play, <br>
you may search your hand or deck for a Gate to Ombor and play it, ignoring <br>
all costs. If you search your deck, shuffle it afterwards. You cannot use <br>
this ability if you do not have a Gate to Ombor in your hand or deck or if <br>
you cannot use Effects named Talisman.<br>
<br>
Additionally, treat Rayje's Belt as if it had the following (see question <br>
thirteen):<br>
<br>
Power - Lockdown: Name any one Power or Effect on a card in play. Until the<br>
end of your next turn, no player may use the named Power or Effect while <br>
Rayje's Belt is in play.<br>
<br>
As explained before, Clarifications are different from actual errata/MRPs in <br>
that they do not change the mechanical functionality of a card in such a way <br>
that deviates from the original, intended use of the card, or from how the <br>
card is commonly played; more specifically, it is clearer text to address <br>
specific rulings issues that arise due to specific interactions of the <br>
clarified cards with other cards.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
ERRATA ANNOUNCEMENT:<br>
<br>
Twee<br>
Naroom Dream Creature<br>
Starting Energy: 1<br>
Effect - Regrow: If Twee is put into your discard pile from play, move the <br>
first Creature card under Twee to your hand.<br>
<br>
CHANGED TO:<br>
<br>
Twee<br>
Naroom Dream Creature<br>
Starting Energy: 1<br>
Effect - Regrow: If Twee is discarded from play, retrieve the first non-Twee <br>
Creature card under Twee from your discard pile and place it in your hand.<br>
<br>
This change is made in light of the surfacing of a new infinite energy <br>
generation deck that focuses on cycling Twees from the discard pile with <br>
Eidon in order to generate one extra energy per cycle. Though there are other<br>
cards required to make this work, Twee is the key to the deck and requires <br>
the smallest mechanical change made to make the entire deck unworkable.<br>
<br>
<br>
This errata announcement becomes legal October 15th, 2002.<br>

1. Does Rayje's Sword allow you to get around Creatures that say: "Core <br>
spells and powers do not affect......"? I would like to know about <br>
this regarding energy removal and other effects.<br>
<br>
RT - No. By the rules and text, there are two types of resistance, and so the <br>
following occurs:<br>
<br>
Piercing vs "The Spell, Power, or Effect does nothing." - The effects of the <br>
Spell, Power, or Effect basically never happen; there is no energy loss to <br>
reduce, because the Spell, Power, or Effect did not even attempt to discard <br>
energy to begin with. Piercing will not allow energy discard to happen.<br>
<br>
Piercing vs "This Creature is not affected by Spells, Powers, or Effects of <br>
the specified region/etc." - In this case, the Spell, Power, or Effect does <br>
nothing to the Resistant card, but still has its effects on everything else <br>
in play. Since the Spell/Power/Effect never attempts to discard energy from <br>
the Creature, energy loss cannot be reduced, and Piercing cannot take effect.<br>
<br>
On an additional note, it has previously been ruled that you cannot play a <br>
Spell or use a Power if you can't select a Creature in play to be affected by <br>
it because of Resistance (or similar Effects); this is both a violation of <br>
the spirit and the mechanics of the rules, and is hereby reversed. So you may<br>
now Shockwave opposing Colossuses to your heart's content, it will just do <br>
nothing to them if they have their Anti-Magic. Any new questions to arise <br>
from this ruling should be directed to the listserv.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Mike asks again:<br>
<br>
2. In light of the recent rule reversal, can you provide a summary of <br>
the recent Climbing Staff rulings?<br>
<br>
a) Can it block Impact?<br>
<br>
RT - No; Impact affects both the chosen Magi and the Creature to be discarded <br>
for the Impact energy removal.<br>
<br>
b) Can it block Dark Ayebaw?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; the cards discarded for Implode are a cost, as well as with the <br>
Spell Implosion, and so the user's hand is not affected by Implode or <br>
Implosion.<br>
<br>
c) Can it block Spirit Drain?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; the number of cards in the opposing hand is public knowledge at all<br>
times, so Spell Drain does not specifically affect it.<br>
<br>
d) Can you play it from your hand with NO active Magi?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, but only in specific situations; if an opposing card is affecting <br>
only your hand, as the hand is the player's domain, then the player may use <br>
the Effect to protect it, and negate the Spell/Power/Effect. If the Staff <br>
will be affecting only the Magi (basically an impossibility with no Magi in <br>
play), then the Magi must be able to use Effects on Relics in order to <br>
discard it for its Spell/Power/Effect negation. So even if you are under the <br>
effects of Crushing Heat, you may still protect your hand, but your Magi can <br>
still not protect themself. This ruling applies specifically to Climbing <br>
Staff currently because it is the only Effect that can be used without being <br>
in play. The card will be changed to eliminate such an exemption if <br>
reprinted.<br>
<br>
e) Can Phrup block CS when it is being played?<br>
<br>
RT - When it is being played, yes; when it is being discarded from your hand <br>
for the purposes of its negation ability, however, it is never put into play, <br>
but simply revealed and then moved from the hand to the discard pile, so Time <br>
Lapse cannot interact with it.<br>

3. Opponent has a Treepsh in play. Treepsh has the effect,<br>
Watchful which states: "Whenever an opposing Spell, Power or Effect<br>
discards energy from one or more of your Creatures in play, you may<br>
discard Treepsh from play. If you do, the Spell, Power or Effect does<br>
nothing. OK. Simple enough. Now, I the active player plays a Flame<br>
Geyser, a Cald spell which states "Discard 3 energy from each Creature<br>
and Magi in play". The Flame Geyser is a spell and is discarding one or<br>
more energy from all of the opponents creatures in play, but at the same<br>
time, it is removing energy from other things like the opponents magi<br>
and the active players magi and creatures. So, I guess my question is<br>
can you pop a treepsh in response to a flame geyser?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes. Treepsh does not specify that the Spell, Power or Effect must <br>
"only" discard energy from Creatures, so even in the Flame Geyser's case, <br>
Watchful can negate it, preventing the Geyser from not only discarding energy <br>
from your Creatures, but the opposing Creatures and all Magi.<br>

4. Tony at Con <br>

Power - Caffeine!: Take an additional turn after this ine. All Magi <br>

if you just took two turn in a row, defeat your Magi, Sleep Dep <br>

<br>
What would happen if I use Tony as my first Magi?<br>
<br>
RT - All of your Magi will permanently gain Sleep Dep when you use Caffeine!;<br>
this will only matter if your Magi Interchanges to a new one (such as with <br>
Giant Parathin), this is to guarantee that you cannot have an Interchange <br>
deck and set up a cycle of infinite turns, or possibly create a multi-turn <br>
cycle with Tony that ends with a Magi with a defeat Effect (like Wessig). <br>
<br>
How about if I use him last, and of course using Caffeine power on <br>
both situations?<br>
<br>
RT - You will lose the game at the end of that second turn, because Sleep Dep <br>
will defeat Tony.<br>
<br>
Is a bit confusing to me since I think that all other Magi will not <br>
be affected by Sleep Dep since none of them can take to turn in a row.<br>
<br>
RT - They can if you Interchange.<br>
<br>
About Rings:<br>
Orwin, Strag, Barak.<br>
<br>
All state that if you only have spells of your region they will take <br>
effect and all cards that are not from that region of your cards, <br>
will be discard.<br>
<br>
So If I have been tainted by Hrada. Can I use a spell from other <br>
region and save my magi from being discard? Since I now will have a <br>
spell in my discard pile from other region, the condition will not <br>
take effect and all my cards will remain in play.<br>
<br>
RT - If you have Spells not of the Purity region in your discard pile, then <br>
the rest of Purity will not trigger, and your Magi will not be defeated. And <br>
while the subject is open, the rules team previously misinterpreted the <br>
wording of Purity; it asks the question of whether all of the Spells in your <br>
discard pile are of the region of choice. If there are no Spells in your <br>
discard pile, this statement generates a false response every time. To <br>
summarize, you may NOT use Purity if you have no Spells in your discard pile. <br>
Any new questions to arise from this ruling should be directed to the <br>
listserv.<br>

2. If a Vulbor Discards 2 cards from a hand, and Abraxin's Crown And <br>
Gilded Cage are the only cards in your hand which card activates <br>
first? The cage? or Crown? Thanks!<br>
<br>
From RT - You may choose the order you activate them both, most likely the <br>
Cage then the Crown, so that you are able to draw cards.<br>
<br>
<br>
From Rules Digest 8/23/2002 Question/Answer #2<br>
<br>
From RT - When you are forced to discard your cards from hand, you can <br>
choose to discard the Crown or the Moob Ring instead of all of the <br>
cards you are about to discard. Once you have discarded one, you <br>
aren't about to discard any more cards, so you can't discard the <br>
other.<br>
<br>
and also,<br>
<br>
Crown and Moob Ring both say 'when you are forced to discard one <br>
or more cards from your hand, you may discard <this card> instead.' <br>
So, instead of discarding any cards to the discard effect, you <br>
discard just the Crown or just the Moob Ring. This is a reversal of <br>
last week's ruling, based on a more thorough reading of the cards. <br>
Sorry for the confusion.<br>
<br>
<br>
Based on this, the ruling from 9/27/2002 is in direct conflict with <br>
the ruling made over a month ago on 8/23/2002. Granted I would like <br>
to see the game played in such a manner that allowed the recent <br>
ruling from 9/27/2002 to be upheld, but the cards and as I've said <br>
the past ruling says otherwise.<br>
<br>
RT - Bear with us; cleaning up past mistakes, and this is another. There are <br>
two different types of "anti-discard" cards; those that trigger when they're <br>
successfully discarded from hand, and those that trigger when you are <br>
supposed to discard a card from hand. Abraxin's Crown, Bagala Fangs, Moob<br>
Ring, etc., have the second trigger; when these cards are discarded, they <br>
negate the entire discard event. However, they have a condition that must be <br>
met to discard them, that one or more cards be scheduled to be discarded from <br>
your hand. Unlike most other conditional effects, though, only one of these <br>
anti-discard effects can usually be triggered because they have the key word <br>
"instead". As soon as you choose the first card to discard "instead" of <br>
letting a discard event happen, then the discard event is negated and no <br>
other "anti-discard" cards can be discarded for the prevention of that <br>
discard event.<br>
<br>
The second class of "anti-discard" cards only trigger when they are <br>
successfully discarded from your hand; Underlord's Shield, Gilded Cage, etc. <br>
Unless they are actually discarded from your hand, they cannot trigger. These <br>
effects can stack, however, and you would choose the order they resolve.<br>
<br>
So, in the example given last week, yes, you can choose which effect you get, <br>
the Crown's, or the Gilded Cage's...But it will be one or the other, letting <br>
both be discarded normally will prevent the Crown's effect, while letting the <br>
Crown's effect happen will stop the Cage from being discarded. We apologize <br>
for any inconvenience this has caused.<br>

douglascamp asks again:<br>
<br>
6. If your opponent's Magi has more energy than their listed Starting <br>
Energy (for example: Gar's Starting Energy is 14) I want to know if <br>
the following combo could work. The combo is listed in order of how <br>
the cards would be played.<br>
<br>
First: Place Abraxin's Crown into play.<br>
Second: Cast an Intensify.<br>
Third: Cast a "Dreamburned" Equilibrate toward your opponent's Magi.<br>
<br>
Based on the order of play I've listed, does the opposing Magi first <br>
remove all energy above their Starting Energy, and then remove an <br>
additional amount of energy equal to what the Equilibrate had removed <br>
due to the Intensify that was played prior to the "Dreamburned" <br>
Equilibrate?<br>
<br>
RT - RT is currently considering the precedence established by the previous <br>
rulings on Dreamburn; some of us feel that it is not only non-intuitive, but <br>
in fact contradictory to the wording on the card. We will take the week to <br>
review the situation carefully, but in the meantime, we will answer based on <br>
established precedence.<br>
<br>
If the Equilibrate can legally affect the Magi, then the Equilibrate will <br>
reduce the Magi to its starting and additionally discard the amount that was <br>
required to reduce it to starting. So if a Magi has nineteen energy with a <br>
starting of fifteen, it will lose eight.<br>

7. In the ruling on Phlouk it was stated that the updraft-effects were ruled <br>
to only count "printed' starting energy.<br>
<br>
The errata versions of Updraft, and its ilk, reference "starting energy." <br>
If this means its "printed starting energy" only, not any altered versions, <br>
does this extend to using Ups from Bagala Fangs, on some random creature, and <br>
then Dream Balming the creature? These also only state "starting energy."<br>
<br>
If the "printed starting energy" is a specific case to the updraft-effects, <br>
then:<br>
During the endless explanations and re-explanations of how Dreamwarp works, <br>
it was said that Dreamwarping changes the number printed in the corner of the <br>
card. Was this only said to help people understand, or is this a <br>
clarification (now) that a "temporary starting energy" is created that is <br>
used for all purposes except updraft-effects?<br>
<br>
I wanted to throw that out there, not to start an argument, but just to <br>
understand.<br>
<br>
RT - Such statements were made to save confusion; the implication was that <br>
changes were made based on the number in the corner.<br>
<br>
The errata to the Updraft effects has been changed to specifically state <br>
"printed starting energy". All appropriate RT-related documents have been <br>
updated. (It has been updated in Bryan "Mr. Tymer" Howland's listing as well,<br>
the most up to date MRP/Clarification guide currently available, found in <br>
this listserv's files section).<br>
<br>
As for Dreamwarp, it does adjust based on the printed value, but it still <br>
creates a temporary number; there literally is no way to change a printed <br>
value on a card short of a new print run of the card MRPing it. <br>

a corrupt and you play an athik which of these happens: a)the corrupt <br>
stays in play and the athik is still underneath, b)the athik is <br>
corrupted and the corrupt goes away or c) the athik is still <br>
underneath and the corrupt goes away? <br>
<br>
RT - The third situation named, the Athik is still Underneath and the Corrupt <br>
goes away. The Corrupt cannot affect the Athik because of its Resistance. The <br>
Corrupt will be discarded and try to take control of the Athik, but <br>
Resistance will allow the Athik to ignore the effects of the Corrupt, and so <br>
it will fail to change control of the Creature or make it Core.<br>

11. You know not once did I see an official request for a ruling on the <br>
Syphon Vortex + Amanax combo. Also, I'm too lazy to read everything <br>
everyone wrote about this, but from what I did read no one ever <br>
mentioned the Abraxin's Crown. (Side note to non-RT people: key <br>
phrase, "from what I did read")<br>
<br>
So my question for the RT, to stop the arguements about it, is if the <br>
Amanax + Abraxin's Crown + Syphon Vortex combo a legal combo to use <br>
against an opposing Magi?<br>
<br>
RT - No. Amanax's Effect Pyromaniac can only be triggered when energy is <br>
discarded from Creatures, even with Abraxin's Crown in play. Dreamburn does<br>
not allow changes to conditional triggers of Effects, only alter the <br>
targetting abilities of Powers and Spells.<br>
<br>
Follow up question: Can Amanax use Syphon <br>
Vortex on a Magi without Abraxin's Crown?<br>

RT - No. <br>

12. I had a question that came up today during a tournament. Does Amulet <br>
of Ombor in play allow a player to search through the deck for a Gate <br>
to Ombor, or does it just allow you to play it from your <br>
deck /without paying any costs/, using a warlum or something like <br>
that. A player interpreted it to mean that you cannot actually look <br>
through and play it, you just don't have to pay anything if you have <br>
another card that will let you do it. I can't give a satisfactory <br>
reason for it to be one way or the other. So which is it?<br>
<br>
RT - Treat Amulet of Ombor as if it had the following rules text:<br>
<br>
Any time that you may play a Relic, as long as Amulet of Ombor is in play, <br>
you may search your hand or deck for a Gate to Ombor and play it, ignoring <br>
all costs. If you search your deck, shuffle it afterwards. You cannot use <br>
this ability if you do not have a Gate to Ombor in your hand or deck or if <br>
you cannot use Effects named Talisman.<br>
<br>
So, as long as the Amulet is in play, you can search for the Gate whenever <br>
you could pay a Relic (just as the Gate says, but this closes the rules gap). <br>
If a player tries to use this ability and searches their deck without having <br>
a Gate to Ombor in their deck, your director should treat the situation as if <br>
the player had simply picked up their deck and searched it for no reason, as <br>
they should be aware of their deck's contents.<br>

1. question A: can you climbing staff sorreah's supress? and how long <br>
does it last?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, but only in a single-player game or if yours is the only active <br>
Magi aside from Sorreah in multiplayer, because he has to be affecting only <br>
your Magi before Suppress can be "Staffed". The effect will last on that copy <br>
of Sorreah until Sorreah leaves play; this includes Interchanging or defeat.<br>
<br>
question B: Harror, Nightstalker: can her effect(the named one) be <br>
climbing staffed, and does that effect prevent say, sorreah from <br>
playing ANY arderial spells, or tony jones from playing ANY <br>
creature. <br>

they may change from finalization to printing, and so some if not all rulings <br>

2. The Dark twins state that they are an alternate harrada but no mention of <br>
who the other twin is (we all assume warada) but yet it doesn't state that. <br>
so the question is as follows can the dark twins get starting cards for the <br>
unnamed magi and if no can you then play with the unnamed magi as your third <br>
magi for the deck?<br>
<br>
RT - No it is not Warrada, yes you can play with her as well. The Dark Twins <br>
may only retrieve their printed starting cards, which include what is <br>
actually printed on the card and anything with "STARTING: Hrada", which there <br>
currently is none. Additionally, as the Twins are not an Alternate Warrada, <br>
Warrada may be played in a deck with them. As seen in fiction, when the Twins <br>
fight, it is basically Hrada that does the fighting, with Warrada providing <br>
occassional support but otherwise staying out of the fray and allowing Hrada <br>
to take the fall. The card was printed to support this idea.<br>

RT - No. A Cald Magi may not bring into play a non-Universal non-Cald Relic <br>
unless the Relic specifically says that the Magi can or the Magi says that it <br>
can. Climbing Staff's unnamed Effect does not require it to be brought into <br>

discarding it.<br>

8. (RT Note - The question was not stated directly, and therefore RT has had <br>
to extrapolate the intent of the message.)<br>
<br>
Can I Spirit Drain a Creature with Dreamburn?<br>
<br>
RT - No. Under previous precedence, this would have been acceptable, but <br>
previous precedence was established under a misreading of the Dreamburn <br>
wording. Therefore, Spirit Drain does not choose to discard energy from a <br>
Magi, and the energy discard is incidental of what Spirit Drain actually <br>
chooses, a player, therefore a Creature cannot be chosen for the loss.<br>
<br>
Dreamburn allows Spells and Powers that can choose to discard energy from<br>
only a single Magi or only a single Creature to be changed, and Dreamburn <br>
changes the Spell or Power to also let a single Creature or Magi respectively <br>
be chosen. Previous rulings allowed a non-specific energy discard effect to <br>
be "redirected" to a new card of the other type if the end result was that <br>
energy would only be discarded from a single source, and this would require <br>
much different wording to be possible. Some specific examples of what is <br>
allowed follow:<br>
<br>
Wildfire - This may not be directed to affect Magi, because Wildfire does not <br>
allow you to choose only one Creature to discard energy from.<br>
<br>
Thunderquake - Though this Spell may be split amongst multiple Creatures, it<br>
may also choose to discard energy from a single one, and so it may also <br>
choose a single Magi to discard energy from (but cannot be directed to <br>
discard X over multiple Magi).<br>
<br>
Maelstrom - Just as Wildfire cannot choose a single Creature if only one is <br>
in play, Maelstrom cannot make that choice of only one opposing Magi in play. <br>
It cannot be Dreamburned.<br>
<br>
Also, in reference to last week's Dreamburn/Equilibrate question, Equilibrate <br>
cannot be Dreamburned, because you cannot choose for it to discard energy <br>
from only one Creature. The preceding is an official reversal, and any new <br>
questions to arise from the ruling should be directed to the listserv.<br>

only allows the Striped Korrit to make itself an additional defender in the <br>

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS: COSTS<br>
<br>
Previously, RT made the statement that a good 'rule of thumb' when <br>
determining if something is an additional cost for the use of a Spell, Power <br>
or Effect is whether or not you lost something before getting a generally <br>
beneficial effect. However, this 'rule of thumb' is not an absolute, and <br>
there are some exceptions. Because of this, we have a small addendum to that <br>
unofficial 'rule': 'Whenever a Spell, Power, or Effect causes you to choose <br>
something of yours that you will lose as part of the Spell, Power, or Effect, <br>
regardless of which point in the resolution that loss occurs, it is a cost.'<br>
<br>
Generally, it is common sense what is and is not a cost, and all cards are <br>
played the vast majority of the time the way they are supposed to be. There <br>
are exceptions when players prefer a strict, sometimes non-intuitive <br>
interpretation of wording, sometimes even for the sake of personal advantage, <br>
and in those cases these clarifications are made. If anyone is uncertain how <br>
this addendum affects the way things have been played, then just ask. <br>
<br>
Secondly, it has come to the rules team's attention that the Effect Imaginary <br>
Friends on the Magi Emlob can and has been interpreted in a way that creates <br>
potentially damaging precedent for future cards. Because of this, we issue <br>
this clarified wording for the sake of removing this potentially damaging <br>
precedent:<br>
<br>
Effect - Imaginary Friends: Whenever one of your Spells, Powers, or Effects <br>
counts the number of Creatures or Bograth Creatures you have in play, <br>
increase the total by three.<br>
<br>
This removes the confusion that Emlob creates literal "fake Creatures" with <br>
his Effect, and clarifies the point that when he counts your Creatures or <br>
Bograth Creatures, he merely adds three to the final total. Bog Stench will <br>
be addressed in a similar manner:<br>
<br>
Bog Stench<br>
Until the end of your next turn, whenever one of your Spells, Powers, or <br>
Effects counts the number of Creatures or Bograth Creatures you have in play, <br>
increase the total by two.<br>

1. Creature type has been defined as any word found in the creature card's <br>
name...(i.e.. JUNGLE Hyren, GIANT Arboll, Chaos PLITH, etc.) But what about <br>
creature cards that have a category-descriptor in their second line? There <br>
are some Paradwyn creatures that are defined as "Jungle Stalker(s)." Some <br>
Magi have "STARTING: X, Y, One Jungle Stalker." Is "Jungle Stalker" also a <br>
creature type? Can this be chosen with Scyalla to make them Weave, or with<br>
Sarazen Outcast for his extra fighting energy?<br>
<br>
RT – No; Jungle Stalker is not a Creature type. When a Card references a <br>
Creature type, it can only choose cards with whole words in the Name of a <br>
Creature on the card, ignoring plurality. The term "Jungle Stalker" is part <br>
of the card's title, which is unrelated to Creature type; the only exception <br>
is when the title lists "Alternate XXXX", then the Creature in question also <br>
counts as a Creature of that type in addition to what's listed. Jungle <br>
Stalkers are a sub-group of Creatures with related abilities, and the design <br>
team wants cards to be able to key off of that group without also having to <br>
lump those Creatures together with the same Creature type. This will not be <br>
the <br>
first group to make such a distinction as you will see more in VotS.<br>

2. Does orwins ring discard evil evu? Personal opinion on this is that magi <br>
are never tecnically in play.<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Evil Evu is a non-Naroom card. The only time a Magi isn't in play <br>
is when he is either defeated, or still face down in the Magi pile.<br>
<br>
does the effect on the ergar stack? even though the effect gives the power <br>
recent rulings with other effects state they don't stack (ie. the hurricane <br>
orish)<br>
<br>
RT – Yes; Spark does not say that you may not have multiple copies of it on <br>
a single Cald Creature, therefore each Cald Creature gains a new instance of <br>
Spark. Also note that Hurricane Orish wasn't a ruling, it was an errata to <br>
the card.<br>
<br>
if I play crushing surf to gain control of an opposing relic yet the only <br>
relic available is one I already have in play what happens?<br>
<br>
RT - You play Crushing Surf to discard four energy from a Creature, then the <br>
secondary <br>
effect of Crushing Surf is unable to resolve as it does not have a valid <br>
target. You cannot have two copies of the same Relic in play so you will <br>
receive nothing.<br>
<br>
Korok (KT magi) says all the powers on my kt cards cost one less to use does <br>
that affect the cost of using soreahs' dream on that power?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, but only if it is a Power copied from a Kybar's Teeth card; <br>
Sorreah's Dream states that all cards that affect that Power also affect <br>
Sorreah's Dream.<br>
<br>
From question one above bloom now states you can use a power on a card in<br>
play would ninx still be able to staredown off a bloom?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes. Though Ninx is Weave, she fits the qualification of having a <br>
Paradwyn Power because she is also a Paradwyn Magi.<br>
<br>
Errata on Eye of the storm has made the card near worthless. However it does <br>
not state you cannot use loaded dice or fate's whimsy on it would those <br>
still be included in altering the die roll?<br>
<br>
RT - No card may alter the result of your die roll for Storm Seeker. <br>
Changing the number of dice you roll would be considered altering the die <br>
roll, therefore you cannot use Loaded Dice or Fate's Whimsy when rolling for <br>
Storm Seeker.<br>
<br>
Does Gia pets ability stack with any other card drawing or limits? (ie. <br>
korremar, a magi who draws three cards or warrada's ring etc.)<br>
<br>
RT - Caps are always applied after reductions. Gia Pet will try and make <br>
you draw one less than two, which is a reduction to one and then Korremar <br>
only <br>
lets you draw one card as the cap so you'll still get the one card. In the <br>
case of Evu or a Magi who would be drawing more than two, where you would<br>
normally draw three or more, the Impede reduces that total by one and then <br>
Mind Shock caps the draw at one. Also note the clarification that multiple Gia<br>
Pets cannot have <br>
their Effects stack.<br>
<br>
universal magi must pay a regional penalty to play all cards why would the <br>
be when no one has to pay penalties to play theirs? (just kinda wanted an <br>
explantion on this one really)<br>
<br>
RT - Universal Magi are from their own region, which is a <br>
jack-of-all-trades and yet a master of none. They must pay a regional <br>
penalty for all non-Universal cards while non-Universal Magi continue to <br>
have no penalty for Universal cards. <br>
<br>
The Universal 'region' is what the Eliwan wielded initially from the time <br>
they started using the magic of the Moonlands. It is the basis for which all <br>
magic of the Moonlands is founded; later on, different regional founders and <br>
elders tempered the practices and learnings of the Eliwan to tailor their own <br>
distinct styles of magic, encompassing the summoning of non-Universal Dream <br>
Creatures as well. While regional Magi had to learn the Eliwan teachings as a<br>
foundation for their more specialized, regional-specific forms of magic, <br>
Universal Magi never fully graduated beyond the initial Eliwan teachings, <br>
either by choice (Rayje), lack of access (Tuku), or lack of practice (Tony <br>
Jones).<br>

3. Ok. I was told that if someone tries to belt the magi, you cant cs it <br>
because it says nobody can use that power or effect. my question is on the <br>
validity in that. Sure, if you belt, say... avenger, nobody can use avenger. <br>
Point being, unless you and I both are playing trygar,or you've somehow <br>
copied avenger onto one of your creatures, nobody else could possibly have <br>
avenger.<br>
<br>
With sorreah, you suppress only one magi. If there were other magi in play, <br>
their effects/powers arent in play. Point being, those powers or effects <br>
arent in play. Yet you can cs suppress, can you not?<br>
<br>
RT – You may use the Climbing Staff to stop Suppress if it only affects one <br>
Magi. You may not use the Climbing Staff to stop Lockdown. Lockdown affects <br>
all Powers and/or Effects of that which was named, but not the card it's <br>
printed on, so even if the Power or Effect is printed on your Magi alone, you <br>
cannot use Climbing Staff to stop it.<br>

4. If I go first with a gia pet in play does my opponent only get four <br>
cards? (vortex of knowledge affects initial card drawing)<br>
<br>
RT - No; There is a specific process in determining your starting hand. <br>
First, you retrieve all of your starting cards, to a maximum of five. Then if <br>
you have less than five cards, draw until you have five. The only card <br>
printed so far that directly affects <br>
the Starting Hand mechanic is Dark Twins because they say you are allowed to <br>
draw up to seven instead of the regular five. <br>
<br>
As for the Vortex of Knowledge and any other cards that would cause you to <br>
draw cards before you have gotten your starting hand, they work as such: <br>
Vortex causes you to draw two cards, then you get your starting cards, to a <br>
maximum of five. After getting your starting cards, if you still have less <br>
than five cards, draw until you have five. If you Vortex of Knowledge Good <br>
Ol' Ashgar, he draws two and then gets to go look for and retrieve an <br>
Arbolit, Quor, Flame Geyser, Boomstick and Krawg if he has them in his deck, <br>
but Strag would still have to give up one of his starting cards, the Gum Gum, <br>
Parmalag, Bottomless Pit, Urhail, Strag's Claws, or Strag's Ring.<br>

5. What? I was under the impression that past Rule Digest dealt with this, <br>
saying that Piercing would allow you to damage a player's Magi in the case <br>
they had a CS in hand. How, when, and why was this changed if this isn't the<br>
case anymore?<br>
<br>
Also, what about a Nalo? It specifically says nothing can prevent the damage <br>
(discard of energy) it causes due to its Power. Surely that means the CS <br>
couldn't be used to stop a Nalo's Power from damaging a Magi? Besides the <br>
Nalo, like the Flame Geyser deals damage across the board.<br>
<br>
Then there is the situation where your opponent has the Arderial Guard Wings <br>
in play. The Nalo should cut through that with no problem right? Then what <br>
happens if you play a The Last Words right before you use the Nalo's Power?<br>
Would the opponen'ts Creatures then take four damage or does the Nalo still <br>
only do two damage? I ask this since The Last Words doesn't say, "nothing <br>
can prevent the damage" it deals like the Nalo card does.<br>
<br>
RT - As with your questions last week we'll reword this into what we hope is <br>
your specific concerns.<br>
<br>
Can you discard Climbing Staff from your hand to stop damage from any source <br>
to your Magi while a Rayje's Sword is in play?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Climbing Staff stops the Spell, Power, or Effect if only your Magi <br>
is being affected. Because the Climbing Staff stops the Spell, Power, or <br>
Effect from even attempting to discard energy, then there is no energy loss <br>
to reduce.<br>
<br>
With a Nalo using Tsunami, can any opposing cards stop it?<br>
<br>
RT - Generally, no; Tsunami states that opposing cards "may not alter" the <br>
amount of <br>
energy removed, so it may not be reduced or increased by opposing cards, <br>
though it can still be stopped by cards that make the Power "do nothing".<br>
<br>
How does Tsunami work with The Last Words?<br>
<br>
RT - Pyromancy does not remove energy from a Creature, it only allows the <br>
Power to remove more energy. All Creatures in play would lose four energy. <br>
Pyromancy also sets up a Global Restriction on the rest of your cards <br>
however, so Tsunami along with the rest of your Spells, Powers, and Effects <br>
may never even attempt to discard energy from an opposing Magi.<br>
<br>
Finally, if a Burrowed creature has already taken two damage from one source <br>
in a turn, couldn't the Nalo deal another two damage via its Power since it <br>
seems to have a built in "Piercing"?<br>
<br>
RT - By established precedence, if the Burrow status is granted by an <br>
opposing card, the Tsunami will discard two additional energy (total of <br>
four), since opposing cards cannot alter the amount discarded by it. If the <br>
Burrow status is granted by one of your cards for some reason, however ,the <br>
energy loss will be reduced.<br>

6. Can you climbing staff trugs' cataclysm?<br>
<br>
RT - No; Trug's Cataclysm affects both your Magi and Trug. Climbing Staff <br>
may only be used if your Magi is the only card affected.<br>
<br>
could you then climbing staff anyother affect which targets a magi? (ie. <br>
Kazm, his effect targets a magi)<br>
<br>
RT - You can only use the Climbing Staff to stop Powers, Spells, and Effects <br>
that are only affecting your Magi or Hand. Kazm's Hunter does not affect <br>
opposing Magi. When a card chooses your Magi for its ability to affect that <br>
Magi's cards, if the Magi is not affected it does not matter to the Climbing <br>
Staff that he or she was chosen.<br>
<br>
ok this one is dumb but a buddy asked me to bring it up. If Trug uses <br>
cataclysm it says discard all cards from play including magi. Does this mean<br>
you could technically burn through your deck and draw up your discarded magi <br>
and play it? (It doesn't say defeat the magi, and if true how would playing <br>
a magi as a creature work?)<br>
<br>
RT - No; Magi are kept in a separate deck known as the Magi Stack and are <br>
never put into your Draw Deck. If your Magi is discarded from play it is <br>
considered defeated and you should place it on the bottom of your Magi pile <br>
face up.<br>
<br>
If I have two darkbreeds minions in play do they affect each other or do <br>
they lose nothing from the effect smolder?<br>
<br>
RT - Whenever a card refers to itself by name in its text, it refers to that <br>
lone copy of the card; the other copies of the card in play still suffer when <br>
applicable, and each of your Darkbreeds will Smolder the others in play.<br>
<br>
Is giving a player a choice to discard cards a forcing to discard? (ie. I <br>
play gloom which says you may discard a card or one energy to save each of<br>
your creatures )<br>
<br>
RT - If you are discarding cards because of an opposing Spell, that Spell is <br>
forcing you to discard those cards even if you were able to choose whether or<br>
not you had to discard them. If the Spell or Power wasn't used, then you <br>
wouldn't have had to discard any cards.<br>
<br>
if Adis is your magi could you climbing staff her effect upon defeat? it is <br>
affect your hand but the effect technically is because she was defeated not <br>
because i wanted to use it.<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; when Adis is defeated, the Effect Haunt is activated. As long as <br>
there is only one opposing player, that player may discard the Climbing Staff <br>
from hand to negate Haunt.<br>
<br>
If I play fog bank does that mean that my magi may be attacked if that is my <br>
only creature in play?<br>
<br>
RT - No; if there is a Creature in play you may not normally attack a Magi <br>
directly. If the Creature may not be attacked either, then no attack at all <br>
may be made even if you have to attack.<br>
<br>
Can Emaal's effect be climbing staffed? (reason: the cost on the card is the <br>
defeat of my magi)<br>
<br>
RT - No; Sabotage is affecting your Magi, your deck (drawing cards affects <br>
both), and your opponent's hand.<br>

7. So, this leads to the question: In light of the Dreamburn rule-reversal, <br>
shouldn't the Climbing Staff vs. Sorreah ruling be reviewed as well?<br>
<br>
RT - No; there are two entirely different situations being compared. <br>
Climbing Staff can be played as a reaction to something that's final result <br>
is affecting only your Magi or hand, so the check is made at that time. With <br>
Abraxin's Crown, Dreamburn checks to see if the Spell is appropriate before <br>
it is cast. Dreamburn states that if a Spell says it discards energy from a <br>
single Creature or Magi, the discard can be instead changed to the other <br>
Type.<br>
<br>
In its simplest form, before the Spell or Power is used, read the text with <br>
the Type switched. In the case of Spirit Drain, it would read. "Choose any <br>
one player. Discard energy from the chosen player's Creature equal to the <br>
number of cards in that player's hand." As you mentioned, this would only <br>
theoretically work if you had exactly one creature in play.<br>
<br>
Since there is no choice made and it is possible for the Spell to result in <br>
an illegal case, it can not be Dreamburned. Dreamburn can only be used with<br>
Spells and Powers that can choose to affect only one target.<br>

RT - Choosing a Magi is not a qualification for being able to discard the <br>
Climbing Staff to protect your Magi. Affecting a single Magi is the <br>
qualification. Tainted Touch only affects your Magi, so you can discard a <br>
Climbing Staff from your hand to stop one instance of Hrada using it.<br>

<br>
RT - No; Exuberence refers to cards that check for the smallest or largest <br>
opposing creature. Flameburst does not look at all opposing creatures. It <br>
only looks at a specific set of them, the limited group controlled by one <br>
Magi, so it cannot be affected by Exuberence; even if the smallest Creature <br>
in play happens to beling to that Magi. It's similar to the Dreamburn ruling. <br>
Exuberence isn't looking for net effect, it's looking for a particular card <br>

can but I want to ask, can Ashgar cast Brushfire for 0 energy from discard <br>
using Combat Reflexes?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Combat Reflexes allows you to play a Spell from you hand at a cost <br>
redcudtion of two and Brushfire says it may be played as if it were in your <br>
hand.<br>
<br>
When a Korrit or Giant Korrit uses Pack Hunt does it trigger Offense on <br>
Strag's Claws? My thought would be yes, because Pack Hunt counts as the <br>
Korrit's attack but can you verify for me?<br>
<br>
RT - Each time a Creature attacks Offense will add energy to that Creature. <br>
In the case of the Pack Hunt, when that Creature attacks with another <br>
Creature, it is attacking and does get the energy bonus too.<br>

last one used will take precedence when checking starting energy. Also note <br>
that while the starting energy change is made, it does not change the printed <br>
value...The change applies almost exclusively to cards that have restore <br>

3. Question: If I played an Intensify and then played an Impact <br>
discarding a creature with 10e, would it do 40e points of damage?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Impact discards X energy, where X is equal to double the current <br>
energy total. Intensify will double the amount discarded by Impact, as it <br>
doubles the energy loss to a Magi.<br>
<br>
Nightmare's Dawn Rerule:<br>
I need to know if this ruling still stands. The last rules team ruled <br>
that Player 2 would receive the 5 energy. I do not agree with their <br>
ruling because a duel region card is not solely of their Magi's <br>
region, unless the Magi is from the same two regions as the creature. <br>
I feel like the word "Only" automatically qualifies then disqualifies <br>
the gain because it is also a card from a region to which the Magi <br>
does not belong. But see for yourself and let me know what you think.<br>
<br>

Player 1 is playing an Underneath deck and all the cards Player 1 <br>

Furok in play.<br>
<br>
Nightmare's Dawn reads:<br>
All Magi who only have cards of their region in play gain five energy.<br>
<br>
Question: If Player 1 casts Nightmare's Dawn does Player 2 get the<br>
extra five energy on their Magi?<br>
<br>
RT - No; Nightmare's Dawn was created and phrased to reward those players <br>
that maintained regional purity, even with the new options presented by <br>
dual-region cards. The second player's Magi is only Weave, and the Baby Furok <br>
is not only Weave, so the Magi does not receive the energy. For the Magi to <br>
receive energy, not only would all of the other cards in addition to the Baby <br>
Furok that Magi had in play have to be Naroom/Weave, but the Magi itself <br>
would have to be as well. To prevent any confusion that can be caused by <br>
sentence structure, however, asnd to fix a generally unwieldy wording, treat <br>
Nightmare's Dawn as if the text were as follows:<br>

that move is "remove from X-creature, add to X-creature." But does this <br>
trigger Nara's effect when I use a spell like Fireflow or Flame Control?<br>
<br>
RT - Fireflow - Yes, Flame Control - No. Fireflow is a move effect, which is <br>
shorthand for discard then add (with a few additional rules), but Flame <br>
Control is a rearrange effect, which does not add or remove energy from play, <br>

to remove its starting energy. The issue was: does a sea barl played by Orlon<br>
ignore all spells? The issue's moot now, but I would like to know for later <br>
reference. <br>

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS: COSTS<br>
<br>
Previously, RT made the statement that a good 'rule of thumb' when <br>
determining if something is an additional cost for the use of a Spell, Power <br>
or Effect is whether or not you lost something before getting a generally <br>
beneficial effect. However, this 'rule of thumb' is not an absolute, and <br>
there are some exceptions. Because of this, we have a small addendum to that <br>
unofficial 'rule': 'Whenever a Spell, Power, or Effect causes you to choose <br>
something of yours that you will lose as part of the Spell, Power, or Effect, <br>
regardless of which point in the resolution that loss occurs, it is a cost.'<br>
<br>
Generally, it is common sense what is and is not a cost, and all cards are <br>
played the vast majority of the time the way they are supposed to be. There <br>
are exceptions when players prefer a strict, sometimes non-intuitive <br>
interpretation of wording, sometimes even for the sake of personal advantage, <br>
and in those cases these clarifications are made. If anyone is uncertain how <br>
this addendum affects the way things have been played, then just ask <br>
<br>
<snip><br>
<br>
So does this ruling now make the discarded Creature on Impact a cost so that <br>
Impact may now be Climbing Staffed?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; discarding a Creature for Impact is a cost, just as returning a <br>
Creature to your hand and discarding its energy for the Gift Spells is a cost <br>
as well. And since the Creature loss for Impact is a cost, it can be <br>
'Staffed'.<br>

card, you must show it to all players so that they know you have taken the <br>

Empress Gia's Effects should be treated as if they said "Effect - Act Like <br>
Gia: If Empress Gia has no Core cards in play, draw an additional card at the <br>
end of each of your turns and your Weave Creatures lose one less energy when <br>
attacked." and "Effect - Fight Like Nagsis: If Empress Gia has no Core cards <br>
in play, all of your Creatures may attack, even those that cannot normally <br>
attack.".<br>

1. Sphor says "Each time a Creature you control is discarded from play, <br>
add one energy to Sphor". Does "discarding" include being defeated <br>
in an attack? How about all energy being removed by a spell?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes to both; anything that either directly discards a Creature (such as <br>
Shockwave) in addition to the mechanical means of discarding a Creature from <br>
play (reducing it to zero energy by any means or if something happens to <br>
specifically defeat a Creature's Magi) is discarding a Creature from play. <br>

2. It has been previously ruled that the "Ring" cards from the league <br>
can only be used if there are appropriate spells in the discard <br>
pile. Using this line of thinking, shouldn't Dream Rift only be <br>
playable if there are cretures in the discard pile?<br>
<br>
RT - No; there are no conditions required to play Dream Rift, unlike using <br>
Purity. Purity needs Spells in the discard pile to compare against, while <br>
Dream Rift will shuffle Creatures into your deck if it finds them there; <br>
otherwise, it just shuffles the deck and allows you to draw three cards.<br>

3. At a league session today, a player brought up a very good point. The <br>
wording on Empress Gia says that she can draw an additional card at her draws <br>
step if she has no core cards in play. However she is an alternate Nagsis <br>
automatically making her a Core card. With the wording as it is, it would be <br>
impossible for Empress Gia to ever draw an additional card even if the player <br>
was running only weave cards. <br>
<br>
RT - No; treat Empress Gia as if he had the changes mentioned in the opening <br>

4. As far as I know this one hasn't been asked. . .<br>
If an opponent's creature (say a 2e Parmalag that has used it's Shield<br>
power) attacks one of Kolte's creatures (say a 5e Weave Hyren) and takes a<br>
Pack Hunting 3e Korrit with it, which creature gets hit by Kolte's Parting<br>
Shot Effect?<br>
Does the Parmalag and Korrit inflict damage simultaneously or what?<br>
Basically, do I get to choose which creature cops the Parting Shot?<br>
<br>
RT - No; in Magi-Nation, when events occur simultaneously, they are still <br>
resolved sequentially, in play order beginning with the active player and <br>
then each player's effects in the order they choose. In this case, both the <br>
Korrit and Parmalag attemtp to discard energy simultaneously, but because of <br>
the timing structure, the controller of the Creatures chooses which Creature <br>
removes energy first, and which second (the defending player also chooses <br>
which attacker the Weave Hyren removes 5E from first, then which second, <br>
after the attacker since the attacker is the inactive player; note that Pack <br>
Hunt will still stop the defending Creature from removing energy from the <br>
Korrit, however, meaning Piercing, etc., will not let the Korrit lose energy <br>
anyway). If the Parmalag discards energy first, then the Korrit will be the <br>
one defeating the Hyren, and will be the victim of Parting Shot, though <br>
unaffected by it. If the Korrit discarded energy first, then the Parmalag <br>
will be affected by Parting Shot instead when it defeats the Hyren, but will <br>
have the energy loss reduced to zero if Shield is in effect.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Also, switch the Weave Hyren in the example above with a Lascinth. How does<br>
the Lascinth's Reflexes Effect work with Pack Hunting? I would assume that<br>
the Parmalag would be discarded without getting a chance to remove energy<br>
from the Lascinth but the Korrit would still inflict it's damage and escape<br>
unscathed.<br>
<br>
RT - No; the Shield will prevent the Parmalag from being defeated when the <br>
Lascinth removes energy, but the Korrit will still be around to remove its <br>
energy from the Lascinth when it's the Korrit's turn. If the Shield were not <br>
in place, the Parmalag would be discarded before energy was removed.<br>

5. I just want to be sure on this issue. Magi A has a Tunnel Parmalag <br>
and an Elder Yark in play, both at 7 energy). Magi B attacks the <br>
Tunnel Parmalag with a four energy Eebit, which goes squish yet <br>
somehow makes it back to Magi B's player's hand. Does the Tunnel <br>
Parmalag take 4 energy damage or only 2 energy because of the Elder <br>
Yark's Regal Presence? <br>
<br>
RT - The Parmalag only loses two energy; Regal Presence is a replacement <br>
effect, and replaces the amount initially remove by the Eebit. Essentially, <br>
the Eebit only attempts to remove two, not four, so the extra two energy is <br>
not reduced since it never is attempted to be removed.<br>

7. Had a player try an interesting tactic with core vs Orothe creature theft <br>
and an odd ruling situation came up. Core had a Dryte Fiend in play and <br>
used Condemn on the Dark Crag Orothe stole the previous turn.<br>
Orothe used Dark Crags ability at 8 energy to discard 5 from the Dryte <br>
Fiend. My ruling was that Condemn did not increase the cost of P/E on <br>
targeted creatures as the energy is being lost as a cost of the P/E rather <br>
than energy loss resulting from a P/S affecting them. Was this the proper <br>
interpretation of Condemn or does Condemn actually increase any costs for <br>
P/E used by the targeted creature by 3?<br>

not actual discard.<br>

Mike asks again:<br>

8. If you use Syphon Vortex/Crown against a Magi, you may be able to <br>

energy from its source and add energy to its destination, and in such a case, <br>
it cannot affect only a Magi and is not 'Staffable'.<br>

9. with previous rulings it was stated that a card was always of the region <br>
checked for. Does (the Nightmare's Dawn) ruling change past precedence. ie. I <br>
play an ormagon my opponnent has one of many kt/underneath creatures in play <br>
are they now no longer just underneath so they are discarded from play? <br>
another example, would typhoon affect the hurricane orish or bubble xyx? <br>
<br>
RT - No, the precedence was not changed. A dual-region card is still all of <br>
its regions simultaneously, but in almost every case only one region matters <br>
at a time. Essentially, when a card effect checks for a region on a <br>
dual-region card, check to see if the region ask for matches up, then do one <br>
of the following:<br>
<br>
Affects only this region and type (Choose a Naroom Creature): If one of the <br>
regions on the card is Naroom, then it's a valid choice, because it is <br>
Naroom.<br>
<br>
Does not affect cards of only this region (Discard all non-Underneath Relics <br>
from play): If one of the regions on a Relic is Underneath, then this effect <br>
will not affect it, because it is Underneath and therefore not <br>
non-Underneath.<br>
<br>
So, your Urigant is safe from Devastate, and your Hurricane Orish is <br>
unscathed by Typhoon.<br>

3. I was playing Core (For some reason) and my opponent was playing Orothe <br>
(League thing...ya know) and I had a good 27 cards in my hand or so, while he <br>
was down to just 2. He proceeded to Riptide me. Here was the question. <br>
Riptide can not normally be CSed, since it effects both hands, however, since<br>
his hand was below 4 cards, he did not discard any cards, so coincidentally, <br>
his hand was "not affected" by the spell. However, that means I could CS it <br>
in that instance. So the question is: "Can I Climbing Staff a Riptide if my <br>
opponent who cast it has less than 4 cards in his hand, since it does not <br>
affect his hand coincidentally." I decided that since his strategy of <br>
emptying his hand before Riptide was awful brave with Anti-discard so strong,<br>
that I discarded all but 4 cards from my hand. <br>
<br>
RT - You're right; Climbing Staff's current wording suggests that you have to <br>
wait, let events unfold, then back up and undo them. Therefore, treat <br>
Climbing Staff's second Effect as if it were phrased as follows:<br>
<br>
"Effect: You may discard Climbing Staff from your hand or from play when an <br>
opposing Spell, Power, or Effect would affect only your Magi or only your <br>
hand. The Spell, Power, or Effect does nothing."<br>
<br>
Also, affecting a hand, as currently defined:<br>
<br>
Affect (Hand, Deck, and Discard Pile): The hand, deck, or discard pile is <br>
affected either when the hidden contents of it are revealed (reveal your hand <br>
to all players) or when they’re changed (searching your deck or discard pile <br>
for a card and placing it in your hand). For example, drawing a card would <br>
affect your hand and deck, because the contents of both are changed.<br>
<br>
When a player uses a Riptide and their hand is not above four cards, then <br>
their hand would not have their contents changed (by discarding), and would <br>
therefore not be affected. This means that, in your example, only your hand <br>
would be affected, and you could discard Climbing Staff to prevent Riptide <br>
from affecting you.<br>

4. After a great day at League my play group and I got into a discussion <br>
on the way home about the Cleansing and Turn cards. In short we were <br>
trying to figure out if the following combo would net the result that <br>
I'll go into detail shortly.<br>
<br>
Combo:<br>
1) Use Cleansing to Cleanse the Turn card to Kybar's Teeth.<br>
2) Locate a Pylofuf in play that has less than its Starting Energy. <br>
The Pylofuf could be one that you've played.<br>
3) Use Turn to (A) take over your opponent's Pylofuf, or (B) restore <br>
your Pylofuf to its full energy. The main point is to make that one <br>
Pylofuf a Core creature.<br>
4) Use Cleansing to change the Core-Pylofuf under your control into a <br>
Kybar's Teeth Pylofuf.<br>
<br>
End Result Question:<br>
By using Turn on the Pylofuf, then Cleansing it to Kybar's Teeth, do <br>
all Pylofuf cards become Kybar's Teeth?<br>
<br>
RT - No; Cleansing may only be used on non-Magi cards that are printed as <br>
Core or considered to be printed as Core, i.e., an Entombed Spell (currently <br>
the only two cards in the game that can edit printed values). Changing one <br>
copy of a card in play to a different region doesn't apply to other copies of <br>
it; otherwise, while that Pylofuf in play was Core, the Underneath player <br>
would not be able to play anymore from hand because of regional restrictions.<br>

<br>

<br>
B. With Zannah (I'm sure this was covered at some<br>
point in time), does my first attack (or spell that<br>
would discard energy from one of my creatures) result<br>
in no energy discard? ie, I have a Forest Hyren in<br>
play with Zannah, if it attacks a Giant Baldar would<br>
the Forest Hyren take any damage?<br>
<br>
RT - Zannah was MRPed to opposing turns only; additionally, unlike Resistance <br>
style effects, which prevent energy removal from ever being applied to what <br>
they protect, Zannah waits for the removal to be applied, then removes the <br>
removal, effectively reducing it to zero. Because of this, Piercing will <br>
still supercede Charm.<br>
<br>
<br>
C. My opponent has a pylofuf, digging goggles, and<br>
strag's claws in play. I have a pair of handy dandy<br>
yark gloves. The pylofuf has 5 energy. If the<br>
pylofuf attacks one of my creatures, who dictates the<br>
effects order and would i be able to "yark" it back<br>
down to 5? or would the opponent get to choose the<br>
yark gloves to go off first and then add one due to<br>
the claws? What about if it had 6 energy?<br>
<br>
RT - Active player's effects always resolve first; the Claws would add one <br>
energy to the Pylofuf, then the Gloves will reduce it to its starting energy.<br>

7. I was thinking, seeing as corrupt technically affects a magi, and I<br>
remember reading somewhere that nothing can affect a magi until they<br>
take their first turn, wouldn't using a first turn corrupt, as many<br>
decks do, be illegal? My memory is fuzzy, and I could be wrong. Also,<br>
If you can use corrupt on a magi first turn, couldn't you Hubdra's<br>
Spear them, or warriors boots a creature and attack, or any<br>
magi-damaging spell for that matter? Maybe you can only do something<br>
to affect a magi if it doesn't cause damage. <br>
<br>
RT - Actually, Corrupt does not affect a Magi; choosing a card and affecting <br>
it, while usually those actions follow hand in hand, are separate events.<br>
<br>
Affect (Creatures, Magi, Relics, and Spells): A Creature, Magi, Relic, or <br>
Spell is affected only when an event alters or would alter their game state <br>
(changing their energy total, removing them from play, or otherwise doing <br>
something that has a direct impact on the card) in some way because of the <br>
type of card that they are (this can be as broad as “discard a Relic” <br>
affecting a Relic to as narrow as “discard all Balamants affecting Balamant <br>
Creatures).<br>
<br>
Corrupt, while it chooses and attaches to a Magi, doesn't actually do <br>
anything to that Magi; it's just there. <br>
<br>
As for attaching Corrupt to your Magi, that can't happen if you have none in <br>
play, but this is remedied by the player usually just attaching it to their <br>
Magi.<br>

creatures that the +2 damage would not be applied.<br>
<br>
RT - Both Valkan's and the Scroll's Effects only apply to energy discard from <br>
Creatures, so in both cases, the energy removal will not be increased. <br>
<br>
Additionally, for simplicity's sake, a move effect adds the amount of energy <br>
that it discarded, i.e., reducing the discard reduces the add, and increasing <br>
the discard increases the add. We apologize for any confusion over past <br>

Whenever any player plays a spell, you may choose any one creature or <br>
magi in play. discard 1 energy from the chosen reature or magi.<br>
<br>
Turn: Choose any creature in play with less than it's starting <br>
energy....<br>
<br>
i'm going on that since you can't target the creature legally so you <br>
can't turn it.<br>
<br>
RT - No; you may not play a Spell if there will not be a valid choice <br>
available to be made for it upon playing it. This is different from a 'legal' <br>
choice; because a Fireball just requires a Creature be in play to choose when<br>
you play it, even if the Fireball will do nothing to anything it can validly <br>
choose, it can still be played. However, the Turn requires a Creature be in <br>
play that it can validly choose (i.e., a Creature with less than its starting <br>
energy) before you may attempt to play it, because the choice of that <br>
Creature also determines the cost of the Spell. This does not inhibit your <br>
ability to choose a different, valid Creature later. <br>
<br>
For example, if there is an opposing Furok and a Leaf Hyren, the Furok with <br>
three energy, and you play a Turn for seven energy to get the Furok, if <br>
playing the Turn makes one energy move from the Hyren to the Furok, when it's <br>
time to choose a Creature, you can choose the Hyren now, since it has <br>
starting energy of X and has less than its starting energy.<br>
<br>
In the specific case mentioned, Spellfire can enable you to choose a <br>
different Creature, but only if there is another Creature in play that has <br>
less than its starting energy with the same starting energy as your intended <br>
Spellfire victim. So, again, with the Furok and Leaf Hyren, you could play <br>
Turn with the Furok as the valid choice, Spellfire the Leaf Hyren, then take <br>
the Leaf Hyren.<br>
<br>
We would like to stress, this does not mean you may choose the Furok, then<br>
choose another Creature later on in Turn's resolution; if you choose a <br>
Creature that becomes illegal after choosing it, then Turn still fails with <br>
no effect and is discarded.<br>
<br>
b) can a Shell protect my orothe creatures from a cataclysm?? would <br>
it make any difference with a relic on the board?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Your Creatures are unaffected by the Spells of the chosen, opposing <br>
Magi, and that generally means an opposing Cataclysm cannot discard your <br>
Creatures; Shell does not interfere with Cataclysm as it is played, but as it <br>
resolves.<br>
<br>

Scott Hebert asks again:<br>
<br>
15. If I have Orothean Belt in play, and I Heal 5 of my<br>
creatures for 1 energy each, will the Belt give each<br>
creature an additional energy, or do I get nothing, or<br>
6 total, or what?<br>
<br>
In general, if I have a Spell that can add energy to<br>
more than one creature at a time, if I play it while I<br>
have the Belt in play, does the Belt give one energy<br>
to each of the creatures targeted by the spell?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; each chosen Creature gains one energy, and the Belt does not need a <br>
Spell to add energy to 'only' one Creature, just that a Spell add energy to a <br>
Creature.<br>
<br>
And in case it was missed when previously ruled, being able to play Crushing<br>
Darkness does not grant you the ability to play the Creature Crushed. If you <br>
cannot play Core Creatures because of regional restrictions, then you cannot <br>
finish processing the secondary effect of Crushing Darkness, and you get no <br>
Creature. <br>

1. about cataclysm: why are colossus and crystal parmalag not <br>
affected? "Discard all non-Magi cards from play. Show your hand to <br>
all players and discard all non-Arderial, non-Core cards revealed. <br>
Opposing cards do not affect Cataclysm as it is played." And I will <br>
not quote colossus but it says all spells, powers, and effects that <br>
specifically discard *Creatures* do not affect colossus. same goes <br>
for Crystal Parmalag. It does not say creatures, spells or relics <br>
anywhere on cataclysm so how are "cannot be specifically discarded by <br>
cards that specifically discard Relics/Creatures" protected against <br>
it when these words are not used.<br>
<br>
RT - Because any card effect that discards another card from play because of<br>
what type that card is (in this case, "non-Magi") specifically discards the <br>
card from play. The phrase 'specifically discard' was intended to reflect the <br>
'specific' use of the word 'discard', and is no longer used on current <br>
printings of Magi-Nation cards.<br>

2. If I use the Interchange power on a Giant Parathin I have in play, <br>
what happens if my current magi is also my last magi? I got into an argument<br>
with my playgroup about how this works: they claim that I cannot Interchange<br>
because I have no Magi left to Interchange with. However, (being the Rules <br>
Lawyer I am), I pointed out that the text on Giant Parathin very clearly <br>
delineates what happens:<br>
<br>
A - Discard Giant Parathin from play.<br>
<br>
B - Place your current (and only) magi on the bottom of your magi stack, <br>
face down and undefeated.<br>
<br>
C - Bring in your next (and only) undefeated magi with its starting energy <br>
(no starting cards, of course). This magi should be rather familiar, <br>
considering you just put it there.<br>
<br>
So the question is, does Interchange function as it is printed, or is there a <br>
ruling buried out there somewhere that prevents this?<br>
<br>
RT - No, you may not Interchange with your final Magi, there must be at least<br>
one reserve Magi to Interchange with; this ruling currently exists, but we <br>
will explain why. Because you do not have a 'next Magi', then we have a <br>
situation such as referenced with last week's Turn question, in that you will <br>
not have enough valid cards to affect (a current Magi as well as a next <br>
Magi). Therefore, you cannot even use Interchange.<br>

3. When you use Hrada's Tainted Touch ability on an opposing Magi, can <br>
your opponent still play Universal Creatures, Spells, and Relics <br>
without any sort of penality even though their Magi is a Shadow Magi <br>
of its original region until the effects of Tainted Touch wear off? <br>
<br>
RT - RT - Yes; the rules already allow Core (or Shadow) Magi to use Universal<br>
cards without penalty. Additionally, Universal Shadow Magi created by Tainted <br>
Touch (for instance, if Hrada's opponent is Rayje) have the ability to choose <br>
whether or not to pay a regional penalty of one when playing Universal <br>
Creatures and Spells, since Tainted Touch says they MAY do so.<br>

4. i have a question with the tomes. I was playing against a pretty <br>
nasty deck with this card in it and the question arose about regional <br>
restrictions. The tomes say that you could play the any spell card <br>
from your deck or an opponents discard pile ignoring regional <br>
restrictions. He played a crushing spell from his deck. What I'm <br>
asking is the crushing spells have card restrictions on them that say <br>
only shadow magi and magi of the same region can play them, do the <br>
tomes ignore that to?<br>
<br>
RT - No; those restrictions are not, by the definition of the rules, <br>
"regional restrictions". Research will not allow your Magi to play a Crushing <br>
Spell that your Magi could not already play, because the only regional <br>
restrictions recognized by the rules are:<br>
<br>
Core Magi - The inability to play non-Core, non-Universal cards. <br>
Non-Core Magi - The inability to play Core Cards and non-Universal Relics not<br>
of their region. <br>

5. In an online match, one player locked down shell game a turn after it was <br>
used. Does this mean that Arosa keeps the creature at the end of the other <br>
player's turn, or does she return the opposing player's creature?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Arosa's Effect attaches a specific duration to the exchange, and <br>
when that duration passes, all Creatures left in play will return to their <br>
owner, even if Arosa has been defeated (another possible way of creating an <br>
'orphan' Creature).<br>
<br>
Also, does Rayje's Belt work retroactively? I.e.: a player is playing as <br>
Ellios and uses dreamhard. He then plays a Rayje's belt and locks down <br>
dreamhard. Does he get the benefit of the dream hard, or does Rayje's belt go<br>
back and nullify the use of that particular dreamhard?<br>
<br>
RT - RT - No; again, these Effects have a specific duration, and will still <br>
finish resolving even if the source of the effect is shut down. In these <br>
cases, Lockdown simply prevents the Effect from activating again during <br>
Lockdown's duration.<br>
<br>
The easy way to look at this is with, say, Elios, as per your example. Let's <br>
say Dream Hard is a cannon that fires during the Energize step and its <br>
cannonball hits the target during the Draw step. Once the cannon has fired, <br>
you can destroy the cannon if you like, but that will do nothing to stop the <br>
cannonball from taking effect during the Draw step ('resolving' the cannon's <br>
'Effect'). This is similar to why a Creature leaving play when using a Power <br>
doesn't stop the Power from resolving; if a Creature blows itself up lobbing <br>
a fireball at you, it's extinction will not stop the fireball flying at you <br>
from hitting, either.<br>

including regional restrictions.<br>
<br>
Do you have to pay any costs if the relic has a cost on it?<br>
<br>
RT - Warlum's Materialize Power allows the Relic to be played ignoring all <br>

Natural Selection?<br>
<br>
RT - All Powers that must be used before a specific step apply to that <br>
specific step of any turn; most recent printings of such Powers reflect that. <br>
If you have a Power that may only be used before your Attack step, you may <br>
Bloom it during the opponent's first P/S/R step, but not during their second, <br>
since it is after their Attack step.<br>

1. Let's say I have 5 Orothe Relics in play (one of them Orlon's Ring), <br>
3 Creatures in play, and M'rika as my current Magi with another Magi <br>
yet to be shown. As I end my turn M'rika has no energy on her.<br>
<br>
The question is this. What happens? Does M'rika's ability go off <br>
first, or does Orlon's Ring go off first, or third possiblity I get <br>
to choose which goes off first?<br>
<br>
RT - When two card effects are triggered simultaneously, the owner of the <br>
effects chooses the order they resolve in. Both Effects mentioned will be <br>
triggered at the same time (end of your turn), and since you control the <br>
order they resolve in, you choose which will resolve first. If you resolve <br>
Purity, then M'rika will gain five energy, and then Interchange will fail <br>
because she has energy. If you resolve Interchange first, M'rika will <br>
Interchange, the next Magi will receive their starting energy, then Purity <br>
will resolve and add five energy to the new Magi.<br>

specifically says it can be played by a Shadow Magi. Does this mean that he<br>
can play any of the Crushing spells, regardless of region?<br>
<br>
RT - No; the Crushing Spells are more specifically restrictive because they <br>
specifically do not allow non-Shadow, non-regional Magi to play them, as <br>
opposed to the Staff, which gives a blanket "okay" to the cards of any Shadow <br>
Magi. <br>

3. Since Bagala Fangs' Ups Power lasts until the start of your next <br>
turn, does a Nodj's current energy be "restored" to 10 if it had Ups <br>
used on it the turn before?<br>
<br>
RT - No; effects that end at a specific time stop immediately before effects <br>
that would occur at that same time. Ups will end, then Nodj will restore <br>
itself to five starting energy.<br>

yaki's guantlets work kinda the same way.<br>
<br>

whereas all of the Ralas and the Tail use 'one additional time'. They will <br>
not be cumulative with each other.<br>

5. Im pretty sure I know the answer to this but I just want to check. <br>
If I have two different Effects on the table that say "at the end of <br>
your turn...", do I choose which one happens first?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; whenever simultaneous effects happen, each player decides the order <br>
their effects will resolve, beginning with the active player, and continuing <br>
in play order. For example, the following "When a Creature (or similar) is <br>
played" effects are in play:<br>
<br>
Your Magi is Ogar (Feral Instinct).<br>
The opponent has in play Wudge (Strengthen) with 2E.<br>
<br>
It is your turn, and you play Koil (Nightmare).<br>
<br>
When the Koil enters play, three Effects are triggered: Feral Instinct, <br>
Strengthen, and Nightmare. You're the active player, and you control both <br>
Feral Instinct and Nightmare; you choose to, obviously, use Nightmare to <br>
discard one energy from the Wudge (Now at 1E). You roll for Feral Instinct <br>
and end up with discarding one energy, and you choose the Wudge again, <br>
discarding 1E and reducing it to 0E. Now would be the time that Strengthen <br>
would normally resolve, but the Wudge is discarded the moment it reaches 0E, <br>
and never receives the Strengthen bonus. <br>
<br>
If you had rolled to add one energy to a Creature and given it to the Koil, <br>
however, then Strengthen would have resolved and added one energy to the <br>
Wudge, raising it back to 2E. <br>

7. If sandswirl is played against a Magi when does it go into affect? <br>
Does it go into affect immediately OR on the next turn? This came up <br>
in a local tournament.<br>
<br>
RT - Immediately; currently, whenever a card refers to the 'next X turns', it <br>
includes the current turn as well. Future cards will be templated to state "X <br>
turns, beginning with the current one". <br>
<br>
The following card errata will take effect 12/15/02. This errata is to <br>
address not only specific problem cards that have recently proved to be <br>
misused from their original intent, but to also address an alternate version <br>
of the Updraft card effect problem, cards that transfer energy from Creatures <br>
to the Magi. Any specific card comments are in-line, and a further <br>
explanation of the reasoning behind the errata will be contained in the next <br>
rules digest.<br>
<br>
ENERGY TRANSFER CARDS<br>
<br>
All of these cards were redesigned to place the starting energy 'cap' on them <br>
that all of the Updraft effects were either errataed to or are currently <br>
printed to have. Such open-ended energy transfer allowed many decks to create <br>
large Creatures and transfer the energy to the Magi, just as Updraft effects <br>
did; but unlike the Updraft effects, only one card, the transfer Creature, <br>
was necessary to cycle. Though these cards have been capped they have also <br>
been changed, for the most part, to allow versatility in their use. <br>
Previously, most of these cards required a transfer of all of their energy to <br>
your Magi or another Creature, forcing you to lose the Creature in the <br>
process. Now, however, you may move a variable amount, keeping these cards <br>
from being simply restricted.<br>

COMMENTS: This card's ability to allow Creatures to replicate all Powers <br>
proved overpowered when combined with such cards as K'Teeb that could copy <br>
strong Powers such as those of Fog Hyren and Poison Baloo Root, enabling a <br>
single K'Teeb to easily draw large portions of a deck or discard an entire <br>

Blooming is not a part of this list because the abuse in question was in <br>
combination with specific Magi, ones that either had enough excess energy to <br>
play such a large group of Creatures at little cost, or ones that were able <br>
to step around the restrictions/drawbacks of the Powers' use (such as with <br>
Fog Hyren).<br>

River Abaquist<br>
Orothe/Paradwyn Dream Creature<br>
Starting Energy: 3<br>

Paradwyn, choose any one opposing Creature in play with less energy than the <br>
number of your Creatures or Relics in play, whichever is less. Gain control <br>
of the chosen Creature. The chosen Creature cannot attack this turn. <br>
Effect - Dreamwarp: As you play River Abaquist, you may increase or decrease <br>
its starting energy by up to one, to a minimum starting energy of one, until <br>
the end of the turn.<br>
<br>
COMMENTS: Previous errata has done little to reign in the unbalancing power<br>
and efficiency of this Creature. This final change should be enough to make <br>
it workable in certain decks, but no longer the unfair power card that it has <br>
been.<br>
<br>
Sandswirl<br>
Arderial/d'Resh Spell<br>
Cost: X<br>
Choose any one opposing Creature or Magi in play. Attach Sandswirl to the <br>
chosen Creature or Magi. For X turns, beginning with the current turn, as <br>
long as Sandswirl remains attached, the chosen Creature or Magi cannot use<br>
any Powers or Effects and loses one additional energy in attacks. After X <br>
turns have passed, discard Sandswirl from play.<br>
<br>
COMMENTS: There were two problems with Sandswirl; first, it could be played <br>
on cards you control, allowing you to negate nameless Effects so that <br>
drawbacks that were intended to be unavoidable could be avoided. Second, once <br>
it had been played, it left for the discard pile. This made it not only <br>
unstoppable once it resolved, unlike other "Lockdown" effects, but allowed <br>
the potential for cycling as well as creating bookkeeping issues over the <br>
cards absence, as players sometimes could not remember how much time had <br>
passed for the card. Both of these abilities combined to make Sandswirl a <br>
splashed staple because of its unbalancing power. With these changes, it can <br>
now be used only to harm opposing cards, as was originally intended, and can <br>
also be stopped with Beam of Light and similar Spell removal.<br>
<br>
Sand Strands<br>
d'Resh/Weave Relic<br>
Cost: 0<br>
Power - Mirage: Discard Sand Strands from play. Choose any one of your <br>
non-Illusionary Creatures in play. Add energy to your Magi equal to half of <br>
the chosen Creature's current energy, rounded up. The amount added cannot <br>
exceed half of the chosen Creature's printed starting energy, rounded up. As <br>
long as the chosen Creature remains in play, it is Illusionary; Illusionary <br>
Creatures do not count as being in play when checking to see if your Magi is <br>
defeated. Illusionary Creatures cannot choose to attack Magi.<br>
<br>
COMMENTS: Mirage ended up being another Updraft-style effect that proved to <br>
add an unbalancing energy gain as Creatures were grown to massive proportions <br>
and then protected as the Sand Strands were cycled to be used again next <br>
turn, once the energy had been moved to a different, non-Illusionary <br>
Creature. This change makes the card effect truly match the Illusionary <br>
condition, allowing for an energy gain at the cost of becoming an Illusion, <br>
but not an unbalancing one.<br>
<br>
Spray Narth<br>
Arderial/Orothe Dream Creature <br>
Starting Energy: 3 <br>
Effect - Congregate: As you play Spray Narth, if you have at least two <br>
Creatures in play, one of which is Arderial and another one of which is <br>
Orothe, ignore Spray Narth's cost. You can only play one Spray Narth in this <br>
way per turn. Discard Spray Narth from play.<br>
Power - Healing Storm: Choose any one Creature or Magi and one of your <br>
Pharans in play. Move up to the chosen Pharan's printed starting energy from<br>
the Pharan to the chosen Creature or Magi. Move up to three energy from Spray <br>
<br>
Narth to the chosen Creature or Magi. Add three energy to the chosen Creature <br>
<br>
or Magi. Discard both the chosen Pharan and Spray Narth from play. <br>
<br>
COMMENTS: See Energy Cap Cards. Also, unlike the larger Creatures, this card <br>
is too small to allow the flexibility of survival after moving energy, <br>
because without the discard, playing a group of these along with other energy<br>
gain cards would still let them retain the ability for abuse they once had.<br>
<br>
VOICE OF THE STORMS<br>
<br>
Habob<br>
d'Resh Dream Creature - Recurring<br>
Starting Energy: 5<br>
ENERGIZE: 2<br>
Effect - Serve: At the end of your turn, if your Magi is d'Resh, you may move <br>
<br>
up to five energy from Habob to your Magi.<br>
When you reveal a d'Resh Magi, if you have one or more Recurring cards in <br>
your discard pile, you may discard one energy from your Magi to choose one <br>
recurring card in your discard pile and add it to your hand.<br>

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS<br>
<br>
In regards to recent errata:<br>
<br>
Recently, we have had to make another (hopefully final for a long, long time) <br>
fairly large group of errata. While these changes were made for the sake of <br>
game balance, the Rules Team took into consideration one of the biggest <br>
complaints about errata and how it affects their cards, usually making them <br>
weak to the point of being "unplayable", as some would say. They call this <br>
'nerfing'. <br>
<br>
First, let's address the errata in question; it falls into two specific <br>
groups. The first group are cards changed to stop their abuse in a specific <br>
deck(s)...These would fall under the cases of the Rala, Rala Tail, River <br>
Abaquist, Sand Strands, and Sandswirl. However, we also believe that cards <br>
don't always have to be "nerfed" if you can find an alternative use close <br>
enough to the original version that it's not a stretch to remember...And it <br>
can sometimes even open up new strategic possibilities for old, usually <br>
somewhat boring cards. Sometimes, a card is simply overpowered, and does need <br>
a fix (as is the case with the constantly revisited River Abaquist), while <br>
other times one deck proves cards to be so generally abusive, that the <br>
specific tangent of abuse is there, and needs to be closed, though the card <br>
itself isn't truly "overpowered", just proves to be when someone tries to <br>
abuse it. <br>
<br>
The River Abaquist, Sand Strands, and Sandswirl all needed to be fixed, and <br>
were summarily lowered in power. The Rala and Rala Tail, however, with the <br>
inability to ever possibly stack it with other Power doubling effects, no <br>
longer makes you lose the Creature when a Power is used an additional time, a <br>
difference that increases the overall usefulness of the Rala and Tail in a <br>
Paradwyn deck.<br>
<br>
The second group of errata were general gameplay changes, specifically <br>
Creatures that have Powers which can be used to effectively mimic the Updraft <br>
effects of old. Because of reliable means of adding excess energy to these <br>
Creatures, they could quickly channel the energy back to the Magi for truly <br>
unfair advantages. <br>
<br>
However, some of these Creatures are staples in non-abusive decks, and both <br>
the Rules and Design Teams understand that. Additionally, unless a deck was <br>
tailored specifically to abuse these Creatures, they never caused any <br>
problems in other decks that benefitted from them, but didn't use them in <br>
bent or even broken ways. With the changes to these cards, we instituted the<br>
printed starting energy "cap" that was placed on the old Updraft effects, <br>
limiting their overall abusive power. But, with a very few small exceptions, <br>
these cards were also made more versatile by the fact that you no longer have <br>
to channel all of their energy away from them if you don't want to, instead <br>
being able to siphon a little at a time if that is all you need. The <br>
exceptions-Pharan, Cloud Narth and Spray Narth-simply proved too strong to <br>
allow this versatility because their small size allows for ease of play and <br>
overpowered use of "global" energy gain effects. <br>
<br>
All in all, the list isn't as long as it seems, especially considering that <br>
Second Order isn't too far away and will be just around the corner sooner <br>
than many realize, letting these cards be reprinted so that there is no more <br>
confusion over errata lists and the like. With no further easily open-ended <br>
means of adding energy to the Magi, the risk of abusive decks of old that <br>
lowered the integrity of Magi-Nation's highest level events are virtually a <br>
thing of the past, meaning that, if all goes well, these errata announcements <br>
will also virtually be a thing of the past. <br>
<br>
Just remember, though many view errata as such it is never a means to punish <br>
the players who spent the time and effort to step outside of conventional <br>
boundaries of gameplay and make these decks, because in all honesty some of <br>
those decks are truly inspired and not built with the malicious intent of <br>
ruining an event or competitive play. Instead, errata is a means of helping <br>
and even rewarding the players who have chosen to stay with us and the game, <br>
helping all of us insure that you all have the best, fairest experience <br>
available, and so you can prove yourself as a player not by the ability to <br>
manipulate loopholes and find the easiest way to abuse resources, but with <br>
the true skill and inventiveness necessary to be a winning competitor. <br>
<br>
Good luck, and may your Weave never be Locked Down.<br>

that he is received just as unanimously by the players.<br>

CLARIFICATIONS<br>
<br>
Morag<br>
Core Magi <br>
Starting Energy: 14 <br>
ENERGIZE: 7 <br>
STARTING: Borgor, Shryque, Dream Rift <br>
Power - Theft: (X) Choose any one opposing Relic in play. Gain control of the <br>
chosen Relic for X turns, beginning with the current turn. At the end of X <br>
turns, or if Morag is defeated, return the chosen Relic to its owner's hand.<br>
<br>
Phrup<br>
Orothe Dream Creature<br>
Starting Energy: 1<br>
Orothe Shadow Magi may play Phrup.<br>
Effect-Time Lapse: As an opponent plays a card, you may discard Phrup from <br>
play. If you do so, return the card being played to its owner's hand. No <br>
energy costs for the card are paid (all other costs still apply). Cards with <br>
the same name as the card affected by Time Lapse cannot be played again this <br>
turn.<br>
<br>
Sand Hyren<br>
d'Resh Dream Creature<br>
Starting Energy: 7<br>
d'Resh Shadow Magi may play Sand Hyren.<br>

play, to a minimum of one.<br>
Effect - Dark Side: Your MAgi may play Core cards as if they were d'Resh <br>
cards.<br>

1. Hey, I was recently playing a game with a friend of mine. He was <br>
playing a bograth deck and I was playing orothe. He had two taglats <br>
out and he used their power to copy the power of my Hubdra's Cube on <br>
both taglats. He then stole my hubdras cube and barqua's bubble. Now, <br>
when he did this what would happen to the relics and the taglats.<br>
<br>
RT - The Relics would be placed on top of each of the Taglats. The Relics <br>
would then be under your control, and you could use them as if you had stolen <br>
them with Relic Subversion. The Relics will stay there even if the Power <br>
leaves the Taglats, though the Relics will still follow all of the "rules" <br>
placed on them with Relic Subversion (if a Taglat leaves play, the Relic on <br>
it is discarded). If a Taglat with a Relic later copies Relic Subversion <br>
again, it will not be able to use the Power, since the Taglat has a Relic on <br>
it.<br>

2. I had a flutteryup in play. My opponent had an aerial flist that then <br>
attacked. It started the attack at 3e, but charge added 1e more to it <br>
bringing it to 4e. In which order would the effects resolve? Does dodge kick <br>
in or does the energy added to the aerial flist not count when considering <br>
effects?<br>
<br>
RT - Both Effects have the same trigger in this situation-whenever the Flist <br>
attacks (the Flutter Yup)/whenever the Flutter Yup is attacked (by the <br>
Flist)-and would therefore resolve in order of the active player and then <br>
other players in play order. Since it's your turn, Charge resolves first, <br>
making it 4E, then Dodge resolves, preventing the Flutter Yup from losing any<br>
energy in the attack because the Flist has 4E.<br>

effect dream burn- all of your powers and spells that discard energy from a <br>
single creature or magi, may instead discard energy from either a single <br>
magi or creature....<br>
<br>
is this supose to mean from BOTH a single magi AND creature?<br>
<br>
RT - No; Dreamburn very simply lets you choose a single Magi whenever one of <br>
your Spells or Powers lets you choose to discard energy from a single <br>
Creature, or the reverse, whenever one of your Spells or Powers lets you <br>
choose a single Magi to discard energy from you may choose to discard the <br>
energy from a Creature.<br>

<br>

<br>
the 'next X turns', it includes the current turn as well. Future <br>
cards will be templated to state "X turns, beginning with the current <br>
one". <br>
<br>
Based on this ruling, does Morag's ability still only count your <br>
turns in relation to the number of turns Morag retains an opposing <br>
Relic?<br>
<br>
RT - Morag, as errataed, actually has a conflicting wording; he refers to <br>
controlling a Relic specifically for your next X turns, then refers to <br>
controlling it for only X turns in general. The following is the "true" <br>
wording:<br>
<br>
Morag<br>
Core Magi <br>
Starting Energy: 14 <br>
ENERGIZE: 7 <br>
STARTING: Borgor, Shryque, Dream Rift <br>
Power - Theft: (X) Choose any one opposing Relic in play. Gain control of the <br>
chosen Relic for X turns, beginning with the current turn. At the end of X <br>
turns, or if Morag is defeated, return the chosen Relic to its owner's hand.<br>
<br>
This is an official clarification/edit of the errata, and all related <br>
documents will be updated to reflect it. <br>

5. If two effects are happening at the same time one time I get to choose how<br>
they are resovled and the other I don't? Can I get a clarification please and <br>
again question five states the same two effects resolving at the same time <br>
you choose which goes first. why is it that when an effect ends you can't <br>
choose to resolve x then have y resolve then have z end?<br>
<br>
RT - All effects controlled by different players that occur simultaneously <br>
have always been ruled to resolve in play order beginning with the active <br>
player. Additionally, if a player has multiple effects that occur <br>
simultaneously, they choose the order those effects resolve. So if Active <br>
Player A has one effect to resolve and Inactive Player B has two other <br>
effects to resolve, and all three happen at the same time, A resolves all of <br>
his effects first, then player B chooses the order in which his two effects <br>
resolve, then resolves them.<br>
<br>
(RT continued) - As for "when an effect ends you can't choose to resolve x <br>
then have y resolve then have z end", the simple answer is game balance. The <br>
more complex answer is that, technically speaking, they are separate <br>
conditions with separate moments of time (until whenever as opposed to at <br>
whenever). Say I've got five thousand animite that I will wait until midnight <br>
to hand out to whoever shows up to claim it, and no one shows up for hours. <br>
Finally, at midnight, someone appears wanting it; it's already midnight, <br>
however, so my stipulation of "the offer lasts until midnight" has passed, <br>
even if someone gets there the split-second it's invalidated.<br>
<br>
Next point question four is wrong unless I can't read my card text or rala <br>
has been errata'd which I will check after I write this so if it has my bad <br>
on this if not the card rala does actually state an additional time? what's <br>
the case here?<br>
<br>
RT - Though the Rala and Tail have been errataed, they have all always only <br>
allowed one additional time by text. The errata makes this absolutely clear, <br>
however.<br>

<br>
This question and answer spurred a question in my mind. If I play <br>
Sandswirl and pay 1 for it, does it wear off at the end my current <br>
turn or at the end of my opponents next turn?<br>
<br>
RT - Sandswirl will stop (and be discarded) at the end of your current turn <br>
if X = 1.<br>
<br>

<br>
7. The Awakening spell says to put it on the table after you play it. My <br>
question is that for spells like Awakening (which don't say that it is in <br>
play), are they ever considered to be in play? I'm just wondering for things <br>
like beam of light. Are spells like Awakening and Sandswirl available targets <br>
for a beam of light?<br>
<br>
RT - Any card that remains on the table is in play the entire time it remains <br>
on the table, including Awakening. Sandswirl (before errata) did not stay on <br>
the table, and so did not remain in play (meaning that, once it resolved, it <br>
was unstoppable, leading in part to its change).<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
jsniegowski writes again:<br>
<br>
7. A. Can you play "The Real Qwade" as a first magi since you have no <br>
previous magi his game text would not trigger or would it?<br>
<br>
RT - The Real Qwade must follow Qwade, or he is defeated when he is revealed.<br>
<br>
B. Does the wind Hyrens text set precedence for all effects as that they <br>
don't stack or does this one specifically limit invigorate to one preventing <br>
the big energize decks?<br>
<br>
RT - The Wind Hyren's Invigorate only applies to other Powers and Effects <br>
named Invigorate (including the Tree Hinko's Power).<br>
<br>
C. Many cards state at the begining of your turn is there an actual begining <br>
of my turn step or is my energize step the begining of my turn, and if the <br>
energize step is the begining of my turn can i then resolve effect (being the <br>
active player) in an order of my choosing?<br>
<br>
RT - Beginning of turn effects occur immediately before beginning of Energize <br>
step effects, just as end of turn effects occur immediately after end of Draw <br>
step effects.<br>
<br>
D.If aula mindseekers power is belted or sandswirled can I then draw more <br>
cards and does her effect affect end of the turn drawing?<br>
<br>
RT - Mindseeker's Power of Windsight creates an ongoing effect that persists<br>
even if her or her Power leaves play or cannot be used, so even in the case <br>
of Sandswirl or Lockdown afterwards, you cannot draw any further cards that <br>
turn. This restriction also applies to cards drawn during the Draw step.<br>
<br>
E. Since storm wings has a power do i have to activate it the turn I play it?<br>
<br>
RT - No; nothing on the card or in the rules suggests that a Power must be <br>
used the turn the card it's on is played.<br>
<br>
F. Can I trigger a spirit spell by defeating my own magi on an opponents turn?<br>
<br>
RT - If you can manage this, then, yes, you may play the appropriate Spirit. <br>
Also, a dual Magi only counts as two magi for deck construction. It still <br>
counts as one magi when in play.<br>
<br>
G. If a looph is defeated while attacking it states i can play a creature <br>
immediatly paying all costs can it also attack that turn (since it is in the <br>
attack step)?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes.<br>
<br>
H. The swamp moga doesn't say whether the bonus two energy removed is <br>
bestowing an effect on the creatures or just bestowing a bonus 2 imaginary <br>
energy (reason asking is burrow)?<br>
<br>
RT - It is doing neither. As with all 'remove additional energy' card <br>
effects, when a Creature assigns its energy total to be removed from the <br>
opposing Creature during attack resolution, the number assigned is increased<br>
by the additional amount. This means that card effects like Burrow will still <br>
reduce/cap the amount. <br>
<br>
I. Is Magam Ringsmith worded properly so that if I trigger say a bog wellisks <br>
effect on my turn that it would have two energy added to it?<br>
<br>
RT - RT - Flame Boost can only be triggered during Magam's turn, with Flame<br>
Strike happening during opposing turns. If you were playing Magam Ringsmith, <br>
and an opponent was able to use Dream Draft to play a Bog Wellisk during your <br>
turn before you played Creatures, it would gain the two energy from Flame <br>
Boost; similarly, if you were able to play a Creature during an opposing turn <br>
before the opponent does, your Creature would trigger Flame Strike and it <br>
would lose two energy. <br>
<br>
J. in regards to flameplate armor does a creatures attack count as discarding <br>
of energy from your magi?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes.<br>
<br>
K.Does the rabid wasperine attack before energy is removed on the initial <br>
target or does it come in after the attack is resolved and attack the <br>
possibly non-exsistant creature?<br>
<br>
RT - Counterattack may not be used until after the attack resolves. If the <br>
Creature that attacked is no longer around, then the Rabid Wasperine simply <br>
cannot attack anything.<br>
<br>
L. also if somehow you had the storm ring in play would the rabid wasperine <br>
gain energy as it attacks?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes. The attack caused by Counterattack is still an attack like any <br>
other.<br>
<br>
M. Does Harror stop the twins from playing all creatures and all spells or <br>
just entomb?<br>
<br>
RT - Just Entomb; references to starting cards refer to named starting cards.<br>
<br>
N. If I phrup a bulabantu will the as you play effect still resolve or does <br>
phrup completely deny the act of playing a card<br>
<br>
RT - Bulabantu's Effect does not have 'as' timing; it does not occur until it <br>
enters play, so Time Lapse will stop it from occuring.<br>
<br>
O. If I use the d'resh card which allows me to reduce a creatures cost by <br>
half can I use that with an illusionary creature and if so can it then cost 0 <br>
to play?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, if no reduction you apply has a "minimum of one" stipulation. <br>
Whenever you have multiple cost reductions, the highest minimum applies.<br>
<br>
Example - You play a Creature with a four cost, and have three effects that <br>
reduce its cost; one by two, to a minimum of two, one by one, to a minimum of <br>
one, and another by one, with no minimum. If you choose to apply the two, <br>
then the first 'one' (minimum one) and finally the second 'one', this would <br>
happen:<br>
<br>
a. Four cost reduced to two.<br>
b. The "reduce by one, minimum one" is applied, but as the "minimum two" <br>
barrier has been reached, no reduction can apply.<br>
c. Cost attempted to be reduced by another one, but this again fails as the <br>
two barrier has been reached.<br>
<br>
P. Does the thrybe allow for spells that reference themselfs, and does it <br>
allow for all spells to be used?<br>
<br>
RT - Only d'Resh Spells may be used, as printed on the card. Also, it allows <br>
self-referential Spells to be used. <br>
<br>
Q. With amulet of sand in play when i play a spell does the amulet resolve <br>
first or the spell?<br>
<br>
RT - The Spell resolves first.<br>
<br>
R.In regards to horizons mirage it states that at the end of your next turn <br>
place the creature in place with its starting energy, current rules have <br>
eluded that your current turn counts as your next turn hence burrow(spell) <br>
costing more and morags power.<br>
<br>
RT - No such references have been made in rulings past; Horizon's Mirage <br>
plays the Creature at the end of your next turn, as it states, meaning your <br>
next turn (the turn you have after your current turn). If the Creature cannot <br>
legally be played for some reason, Horizon's Mirage is still discarded, and <br>
the Creature (with nowhere else to go) is placed in the discard pile.<br>
<br>
S.If a power is having it's cost reduced and increased at the same time which<br>
resolves first? ex spell making core powers cost two less frozen makes zungs <br>
power cost one more which resolves?<br>
<br>
RT - Such conditions on cards in play do not trigger and resolve; they are <br>
static. If a Power costs one additional energy to play and simultaneously <br>
costs two less energy to play, as long as the requirements for those changes<br>
are met, the end result is the Power costing one less energy to play.<br>
<br>
T.If multiple cards are reducing the cost of a card sand hyren and the like <br>
if any didn't say minimum zero would you be able to resolve the effects in <br>
order so that the last one reduces the card to zero?<br>
<br>
RT - See O above. If none of the reductions have a minimum, they can keep <br>
stacking, up to a reduction of zero.<br>
<br>
U. would the icefield ashryte be able to discard a tunnel parmalag from a <br>
straight kybars teeth magi or a striped korrit from a straight weave magi?<br>
<br>
RT - No; they share regions with their Magi, and so are not of a different <br>
region.<br>

8. In regards to the question on 'When' vs. 'As' cards, I would like an <br>
official answer to the Hurricane Orish dillema.<br>
<br>
A) All cards which say 'when' trigger only after all events related <br>
to the triggering event are completed, and only (of course) if the <br>
card in question is still in play when it would trigger. Is this true?<br>
<br>
RT - As follows:<br>
<br>
As - When the card is revealed or event declared, after all costs are played, <br>
but before a card resolves/enters play.<br>
<br>
When/Whenever - After the card or event in question has resolved.<br>
<br>
Immediately after - Same as When/Whenever, but before anything else can <br>
happen, evern other 'immediately after' effects.<br>
<br>
B) Phrup has MRP or clarifications which cause it to work as if it <br>
said 'As...'. Is this true?<br>
<br>
RT - Time Lapse has previously been clarified to have 'As' timing, yes:<br>
<br>
Phrup<br>
Orothe Dream Creature<br>
Starting Energy: 1<br>
Orothe Shadow Magi may play Phrup.<br>
Effect-Time Lapse: As an opponent plays a card, you may discard Phrup from <br>
play. If you do so, return the card being played to its owner's hand. No <br>
energy costs for the card are paid (all other costs still apply). Cards with <br>
the same name as the card affected by Time Lapse cannot be played again this <br>
turn.<br>
<br>
C) Time Lapse versus Spell Drain; does Spell Drain add the energy to the Magi?<br>
<br>
RT - No; the card never gets to satisfy the timing requirement of Spell Drain.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Mike asks again:<br>
<br>
9. Karse's Effect Fury states: "Each of your Orothe And Universal cards <br>
that costs seven or more energy costs three less energy to play"<br>
<br>
How would this affect a Tidal Wave hitting 2 ceatures? My first <br>
thought was that the cost reduction would not work because the first <br>
half of the spell costs 6 and the second half costs an additional 4. <br>
But then I read the text more carefully and noticed that it <br>
says "cards". Hitting two creatures would make the "card" cost 10 to <br>
play. What do you think?<br>
<br>
RT - No, the Tidal Wave would not be reduced by Fury; Tidal Wave is a six <br>
cost Spell with a secondary effect that allows you to pay four energy to <br>
choose and discard a second Creature during its resolution. This does mean <br>
that the choice to pay the four extra can wait until the Spell is <br>
successfully resolving and the first Creature is discarded, in case <br>
discarding the first Creature somehow gives you the energy you need to <br>
discard the seond. But, this does not let you choose the first Creature again <br>
if the first discard attempt fails; the "second Creature" must be different <br>
from the first. <br>

10. We had a auestion about Darkbreed's Minion and Scyalla's Starting <br>
Cards/Pet Project:<br>
<br>
Can Scyalla start with two Darkbreed's Minion and have the creature <br>
type be minion even though they are alternate Ash Hyrens?<br>
<br>
RT - No, for two reasons. One, she cannot start with two of the same card. <br>
Two, Darkbreed's Minion is a Hyren (Ash Hyren). An Alternate card is <br>
considered to also have the Alternate name written in the name box (in this <br>
case, "Darkbreed's Minion/Ash Hyren"), so being able to start with one <br>
entitles you to start with the other, or not start with, etc. Because "Hyren" <br>
is in the Creature's name, technically speaking, the Creature is a Hyren, and <br>
is illegal to be chosen.<br>
<br>
If so, then I'd assume Scyalla can use pet project to make minion's <br>
part of the weave.<br>
<br>
RT - Actually, she can, by naming "Darkbreed", "Minion", or "Ash" as her <br>
Creature type. All the 'non-Hyren' stipulation in Pet Project means is that <br>
you cannot name "Hyren", but any other type, even if it encompasses a class<br>
of Hyren (Forest, Ash, Night, Mushroom, etc.) is fair game.<br>
<br>
11. The text for frozen creatures says that powers on those creatures <br>
cost an additional energy to use. If those powers normally do not <br>
have a listed energy cost, are they assumed to have a cost of zero in <br>
normal play and a cost of one energy when that creature is frozen? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; a frozen card with a Power that has no energy cost gains an <br>
additional energy cost of one.<br>
<br>

jsniegowski asks again:<br>
<br>
12. A. If a creature looses zero energy in an attack or from a spell does <br>
sunburn add two more, or does sunburn only trigger when damage is done<br>
<br>
RT - No; Sunburn only increases energy loss when energy loss actually occurs. <br>
If no energy is discarded, then Sunburn does nothing.<br>
<br>
B.Essence of frost states that all cards in play are frozen. didn't a <br>
previous ruling state that magi never have themself in play so essence of <br>
frost wouldn't affect them?<br>
<br>
RT - A Magi does not have itself in play, but a Magi, like any other card on <br>
the table that doesn't say otherwise, is in play. Essence of Frost would <br>
freeze the Magi.<br>
<br>
C.when fiend of furoks plays a furok is it technically a core creature or is <br>
it still the region it is when played from the discard pile.<br>
<br>
RT - The Furok is still of its printed region(s); unless it is a Dark Furok, <br>
it probably won't be Core.<br>
<br>
D.Is using a power on a creature considered discarding energy from the <br>
creature? (hence triggering dryte fiend or sunburn)<br>
<br>
RT - No; spending energy to use a Power does not trigger any lose/discard <br>
effects.<br>
<br>
E.spirit of core does not state a shadow magi can play it, is it truely <br>
limited to just core magi? (like the crush spell?) and if that is true could <br>
you entomb a spirit spell for a shadow magi?<br>
<br>
RT - Crushing Darkness cannot be played by Shadow Magi; Spirit of the Core<br>
does not have that restriction, and can be played by all Core Magi, even <br>
Shadow Magi. Entombing a regional Spirit would not allow Shadow Magi to play <br>
it, though it would stop non-Core Magi of the region from playing it.<br>
<br>
F. If I play spirit of arderial I am correct in assuming i have not discarded <br>
a card from an opponents hand?<br>
<br>
RT - Shuffling cards into a deck is not considered discarding them.<br>

14. A. The coal ergar has quite a bit of text. One thing it doesn't state is <br>
the order in which the effects of its power resolve themselves. Am I corect <br>
in assuming that the active player can choose the order in which they <br>
resolve, or do you have to follow the order the text is written in?<br>
<br>
RT - It states the order the effects resolve; first, discard one energy from <br>
each opposing Creature with more energy than Coal Ergar. Next, discard one <br>
energy from each Orothe Creature. Finally, discard two energy from Coal Ergar.<br>
<br>
B. There are creatures that discard energy from opposing creatures and state<br>
that the energy loss cannot be modified by opposing cards. I'm just curious <br>
as to whether you can use the scroll of fire to modify the energy discarded <br>
by say, a nalo.<br>
<br>
RT - If the energy loss specifically cannot be modified by "opposing" cards, <br>
then your cards are free to modify the energy loss; in the case of Nalo, your <br>
cards may increase or decrease the energy removed, but opposing cards cannot. <br>
<br>
C. This one is kinda weird. I was just thinking about how Rayje's Sword cuts <br>
through just about anything. So I was wondering if Rayje's Sword cuts through <br>
Rayje's Belt when Piercing is locked down? (I know that lockdown probably <br>
over-rides everything, but I'm just curious). <br>
<br>
RT - If Piercing cannot be used, it cannot be used; Lockdown "beats" <br>
Piercing. <br>
<br>
D. This one's about Kesia. The text on Kesia says that she can only play <br>
Weave spells. Is she able to play Universal spells at all, or does her <br>
restriction extend to every non-Weave spell card?<br>
<br>
RT - No; she cannot play Universal Spells.<br>
<br>
E. The spirit cards say that you can only play one per magi. Does this mean <br>
only one per type of spirit card (i.e. with a dual region magi you have the <br>
choice of two different spirit cards)? Or are you restricted to only being <br>
able to play one spirit card period?<br>
<br>
RT - Only one Spirit card may be played when a Magi is defeated; this means<br>
that a dual Magi cannot play two Spirits from their region, nor can a <br>
dual-region Magi play a Spirit of each of their regions.<br>
<br>
F. Finally, this one is in regards to anti-discard cards. If you can't <br>
legally put a relic into play, can you still use the effect on it to counter <br>
a hand discard (I think this was already answered so if you know the answer, <br>
please just email me)? I.e. you're holding an Underlord's shield an opponent <br>
causes you to discard a card; can you choose the shield and use it's effect <br>
if your magi is not able to use Underneath relics?<br>
<br>
RT - No; if you cannot play the Underlord's Shield, then it will go to the <br>
discard pile when discarded from your hand. <br>

what about yerthe, would he be able to get any one hyren, or rayje, <br>
any universal card?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, the effect is permanent, no, you cannot Redream an 'any' card; when <br>
a card refers to affecting based on starting cards, it means only named <br>
starting cards. Rayje could Redream nothing, Yerthe could only Redream a <br>
Staff of Hyren, etc.<br>

21. Dakat's Power says: Power - Deja Vu: (2) Discard a card from your hand. <br>
The<br>
next time this turn one of your Spells or Powers removes energy from an<br>
opposing Creature, choose another Creature in play. Remove an equal amount<br>
of energy from the chosen Creature.<br>
<br>
How does this work with Spells like Thunderquake and Stone Storm? Say I<br>
play a TQ for 10E and choose 3 Creatures removing 5E from the first, 3E from<br>
the second and 2E from the third. Do I then choose 3 more Creatures and<br>
remove the same amounts of energy from each of those Creatures? Could you<br>
choose the same Creatures in a different order after each has damaged<br>
removed? Or do you choose another Creature after assigning the energy loss<br>
to the *first* Creature? Or does his Power even work with Spells like TQ<br>
and Stone Storm?<br>
<br>
RT - Deja Vu is worded ambiguously; the intent is the next single Creature, <br>
and so a Thunderquake (or similar multi-affecting Spell) is not triggered by <br>
Deja Vu. If the Thunderquake is discarding energy from only one Creature, <br>
then Deja Vu may then amplify it.<br>

<br>
Is "attach" formally defined, or is it simply a convention to make<br>

<br>
RT - Attaching is the act of taking the card that is being attached and <br>
placing it with the card it is being attached to, or otherwise note that they <br>
are 'together'. As for Spells that attach being imbued as a Power, the Spell <br>

ever is less." What if I have zero creatures and three relics in <br>

I have just creatures or just relics in play I can take a 2 energy <br>

Power that discards all Quors affects Stone Quors and Quor <br>
Pups, too." I presume this is supposed to read, "If a Spell, <br>
Power, or Effect ...." ? Also, I recall a ruling that Liriel was only <br>
supposed to be able to retrieve Bagalas, not Bagala Cubs and <br>
Bagala Hunters with her power. Am I imagining things? Given <br>
the rulebook, she should be able to get any of those, right?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Spells, Powers, and Effects, not just Spells and Powers. As for <br>
Liriel, she may take any Creature with "Bagala" in the name, including Cub <br>
and Hunter, but not just any card with Bagala (so no Bagala Fangs).<br>

play on an opponents turn, you may discard Magam's Ring from play to <br>
restore the Creature to it's starting energy instead." I just want <br>
to be sure. Does Rebirth save both a creature being shockwaved as <br>
well as the creature being discarded by Inferno Xyx's Blast (having <br>
all it's energy directly discarded). Also, does Magam's Ring work <br>
differently from Emec's Forge in that the Creature being Rebirthed <br>
gets restored to starting energy even though it was not at starting <br>
energy when being discarded? <br>
Example: my Rock Slith is at 4 energy. It gets attacked by a Rous at <br>
6 energy and is defeated. Will discarding Magam's Ring restore the <br>
Rock Slith to full? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Rebirth restores the Creature to its starting energy, regardless of <br>
how it would be discarded during an opponent's turn.<br>
<br>
Does the effect on Grizzled Moga stack? If I have more than one <br>
Grizzled Moga in play, does my opponent's magi lose an energy for <br>
each Grizzled Moga I have in play whenever my creatures attack? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; there is no specified limit, and so the effects are cumulative.<br>
<br>
Ullig wants to cast Stand and Take It twice and put both spells on <br>
the Greater Garganor, and then discard them one per attack? Or will <br>
one attack trigger both spells at once, saving the Greater Garganor <br>
from the first Uwamar attack but letting it get slaughtered by the <br>
second and leaving Ullig to take on the Drush alone? <br>
<br>
RT - All copies of Stand and Take it attached to the Creature are triggered <br>
and discarded from play.<br>
<br>
Oranragon has Stand and Take It attached. Does Oranragan gain 2 energy from <br>
Vengeance <br>
when Stand and Take It is discarded from play by the opposing <br>
creature attack? <br>
<br>
RT - No, because it is being discarded by its own effect, not the effect of <br>
an opposing card.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Reddius asks again:<br>
<br>
30. A. Cawh says:<br>
Other cards cannot prevent Cawh from losing energy.<br>
<br>
First I guess this is a text and is not part of the Fearsome effect, <br>
right?<br>
<br>
Second other can't prevent Cawh from lossong energy, so an Inferno <br>
Xyx and a Storm Cloud could easyly wipe out Cawh.<br>
<br>
But my question is that: If I can save Cawh from cards like Inferno <br>
Xyx and a Storm Cloud with the Barqua's Bubble and Shell since is <br>
not preventing it from losing energy, it's just that Cawh cannot be <br>
affected by Powers and Spells.<br>
<br>
RT - 'Other cards cannot prevent Cawh from losing energy' is part of <br>
Fearsome. Additionally, nothing can stop Cawh from losing energy, even the <br>
effects of Barqua's Bubble's Power or Shell.<br>
<br>
B. Can Brothers of Vengeance use Giant Parathing's Interchange Power <br>
since they count as two Magi?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, they may Interchange normally.<br>
<br>
C. Can Niffer Revive The Dark Twins using as Abwyn's Qill and a Ritual <br>
Spear, since The Dark Twin counts as two Magi? The same can be done <br>
with the Brothers of Vengeance.<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; generally, this is pointless, however, because most every dual-Magi<br>
is worthy of that only from their starting energy totals, which are lost <br>
because the Spear passes the energy of the Magi using it. However, it could <br>
very well be a remarkable strategy with Korg & Zet, that have great <br>
energizes, though having them first is asking for trouble. So, all in all, <br>
not very helpful, but still allowed, because it is still a single Magi in the <br>
game, just counts as two when making a deck.<br>
<br>
D. Tunnel Spell<br>
Can a burrow creature can attack the Magi without having a Digging <br>
Goggles or any other thing that allows burrow creatures to attack?<br>
<br>
RT - Tunnel grants the ability for the Creature to attack without Goggles or <br>
similar cards, but to only choose the Magi as a defender in the attack.<br>
<br>
E. Wasperine Stalker<br>
I want to know if the part that says: "When you play wasperine <br>
stalker and to energy to it if your Magi is Woot." Is a text or part <br>
of the blur effect?<br>
<br>
RT - The energy add for Woot is rules text, not part of Blur.<br>
<br>
F. If is text the it could be activate again if it's revive with a <br>
Furok Guardian, right?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, it would be reused if it is brought into play again.<br>
<br>
G. Rabid Wasperine<br>
If this creature can attack before energy is remove from the <br>
defending creature?<br>
<br>
RT - No; the initial attack must be fully resolved before Rabid Wasperine can <br>
attack.<br>
<br>
H. Is the wasperine taking the place of the defender? Protecting it.<br>
<br>
RT - Neither; it is making a separate attack after the attack triggering it <br>
entering play has resolved.<br>
<br>
I. Rabid Bisiwog<br>
Can it choose 2 creatures to attack if a Sarazen Guard or a Mosp is <br>
in play? The defending creature lose twice the amount of energy?<br>
<br>
RT - Rabid Bisiwog says "you MAY choose two Creatures." If you decide to <br>
choose two, you must choose two that can be legally attacked. If the opponent <br>
controls Mosp, you may not choose a non-Mosp Kybar's Teeth Creature as a<br>
defender, though if your opponent had a non-Kybar's Teeth Creature in play, <br>
you could choose to attack both the non-Kybar's Teeth creature and the Mosp. <br>
Further, Rabid Bisiwog will only remove energy once from each creature it <br>
attacks, including Sarazan Guard, even if the Guard's Protect effect prevents <br>
the Bisiwog from attacking two other creatures.<br>

braggle and barak's ring: will it be discarded by purity if morphed?<br>

<br>
sandcape and nemsa: will the sandcape's effect allow u to trigger the <br>
nemsa's effect from the discard?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; even if playing the starting card is what lessened your hand, you <br>
may still then use Nemsa's Effect combined with Sand Cape's to put it into <br>
play.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Lazarus Agbowo asks again:<br>
<br>
32. The text on spirit of paradwyn says that the cost of your creatures <br>
played before the attack step is increased by 2 and cannot be reduced. Does<br>
this mean that you can't dreamwarp your creatures in, or can you dreamwarp <br>
them, but still pay the 2 extra energy? <br>
<br>
RT - You may still use Dreamwarp, because reducing the starting energy amount <br>
changes the base cost (without technically reducing it), but the cost of the <br>
Creatures cannot be reduced (Robe of Petals and the like). <br>
<br>

B. When you play Foucs, can O'Qua or Tony Jones still use their <br>

34. This is probably a basic question that may have been answered already. <br>
I apologize beforehand if it has. I am just a bit confused on the <br>
Illusion creatures nameless effect that states "As you play illusion <br>
creature, reduce its cost by x". In Drahkar's case, it is an eleven <br>
energy dream creature and its x reduction cost is 5. So, reading it <br>
word for word, as I should, Am I understanding this correctly that when <br>
I play Drahkar from my hand, I am paying 6 energy from my magi and <br>
putting it into play as a 6 energy creature? To get to 11 energy, I <br>
would need a way to return it to its starting energy, right? Thanks <br>
much for your help.<br>
<br>
RT - When a Creature comes into play, with few exceptions, it enters play <br>
with its starting energy value, regardless of the cost paid. An Illusion that <br>
has a starting energy of nine and a cost reduced to five will still receive <br>
nine energy when it enters play. The main exception to this rule are <br>
Dreamwarpers; they do not Dreamwarp their cost, but starting energy as a <br>
whole, and that will alter the amount they enter play with.<br>

SSJ_Mato writes again:<br>

35. A. Does a Rock Slith's Hide trigger when it is discarded from play by <br>
having all of it's energy discarded by Dessicate or a Storm Cloud <br>
plus Scroll of Fire or Valkan's Pyromancy? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; it has no energy to move, however, but you do still get to draw a <br>
card.<br>
<br>
B. Does Sandstone Hyren's Monolith kick in each time a spell or power <br>
tries to target it or just the first time that turn? <br>
RT - As long as it remains the largest Creature in play, three additional <br>
energy must be payed by a Magi to choose it for Spells and Powers.<br>
<br>
C. Also, if a player has more than one Sandstone Hyren in play does the <br>
extra energy cost from Monolith count for each one or once one has <br>
been triggered the other one is null? <br>
RT - When a card refers to itself, it applies only to that specific copy. <br>
Additionally, there is nothing in Monolith's text that would limit the use of <br>
the Effect as long as the conditions are met. Though in the case of multiple <br>
Sand Hyrens, they can't all be the largest Creature in play; if each one has <br>
the greatest energy total, but all have the same amounts, Monolith cannot be <br>
used.<br>
<br>
D. What if there are two Sandstone Hyrens of the same size? Assume that <br>

Monolith now void? <br>
<br>
36. How do you process the timming on effects that states whenever...<br>

Would you get to draw your card if somebody TQ your Frusk to death? <br>

to draw a card with.<br>
<br>
If you're Gherish, could you take 1e off an Ormagon when he <br>

<br>
RT - It will affect your next Magi, regardless of region. For instance, if <br>
your first Magi was Traveling Healer and your next Magi was Magam, <br>
Flamesmith, if you played Spirit of the Teeth when Traveling Healer is <br>
defeated Magam would still gain the benefits of it.<br>

a Grizzled Moga attacks, thanks to its effect. When a Giant <br>
Balder attacks, would Lanyx have lost a third energy before <br>

39. How many cards do I get to retrieve from my discard pile if I have 3<br>
Corathans in play and discard an opposing Creature with Crushing Darkness,<br>
thus gaining control of said opposing Creature? 1 - because of the once per<br>
turn clause in post-eratta Corathan OR 3 - because all three Corathan's<br>
Effects are triggered by the Crushing Darkness and the once per turn clause<br>
applies to each Corathan OR 0-3 - depending on how many Corathan's I choose<br>
to take cards back with. . .<br>
<br>
RT - None; Crushing Darkness does not take control of a Creature with its <br>
secondary effect, it allows you to play a completely new Creature. <br>
Additionally, only one Corathan Effect may be used per control change.<br>
<br>
Also, can the Corathan's Effect retrieve the card just played, for example<br>
the Crushing Darkness that gained me control of an opposing Creature? I'm<br>
guessing not, because the spells actions are completed before discarding the<br>
spell, correct?<br>
<br>
RT - Again, Crushing Darkness does not make the Creature switch controllers; <br>
it lets you play a new Creature. And, generally, no, Corathan's Effect cannot <br>
retrieve the 'theft' card, because it is discarded immediately after the card <br>
resolves, and the Corathan's Effect interrupts this process before the <br>
'theft' card can be discarded. The most notable exception is Corrupt; it is <br>
discarded before its effect occurs, and so a Corathan may retrieve it.<br>

<br>
41. Quick question: I'm playing with a Cawh and my opponent sticks out a <br>
Rayje's sword. I cast a shell/tranquility/entangle/barqua's bubble. Does <br>
using these spells/relic count as energy loss prevention for the sake of the <br>
cawh's effect/rayje's sword?<br>
<br>
RT - These effects are not energy loss reduction, but they are energy loss <br>
prevention. There are two different csopes of energy loss prevention:<br>
<br>
Energy loss reduction: This applies to anything that changes an assigned <br>
energy removal amount after it is assigned (burrow, Invulnerability, etc).<br>
<br>
Energy loss prevention: This encompasses not only reduction but also <br>
encompasses effects that would stop effects from discarding energy <br>
(Resistance, Shell, etc).<br>
<br>
This is why Piercing does not get past Resistance, but Fearsome allows energy <br>
loss to get past Shell. Piercing only applies to reduction, not full <br>
prevention; so, yes, those effects listed are energy loss prevention, but not <br>
reduction. Fearsome's weakness will override them, but Piercing will not.<br>

B) Your opponent currently has a Hubra's Cube with a relic on top of <br>

your opponent's Hubra's Cube using the Hubra's Cube's power of Relic <br>
Subversion? If so, do "gain control" of the relic that was on top of <br>
the Hubra's Cube or do you only get the Hubra's Cube using Koza's <br>
power?<br>
<br>
RT - Neither. Relic Subversion cannot be used if there is a Relic on the <br>
Hubdra's Cube; Koza does not copy Powers, he just uses Powers as if the <br>
Relics were his as well. However, if there wasn't a Relic on the Cube and <br>
Relic Subversion was used, you would gain control of the chosen Relic, and <br>
the opponent would no longer be able to use Relic Subversion (the one who <br>
uses the Power gains control of the Relic, but the Power cannot be used while <br>
there is a Relic on top of Hubdra's Cube).<br>
<br>
It must be noted that Koza's Effect doesn't state he copies the Powers, <br>
merely that he can use them; this is what causes such potentially strange <br>
occurences.<br>

The phrasing of the first answer was implying the wording of Awakening, <br>
Geysers, etc (play this card on the table), as well as cards that "attach". <br>
Cards that are placed under other cards (such as with Gia's Tome) do not <br>
attach and are not in play.<br>

<br>
The timing words have never really had concrete definitions until now, and <br>
this has caused some wording problems. When the cards were first written, the <br>
idea was that there would be no need for various timing verbs, etc., and so <br>
there was no standardization for them. However, as sets passed and different <br>
design teams with them, some words were used to signify specific timing more <br>
and more often until we have the almost concrete definitions of now. Without <br>
making a large list of clarifications, it's going to have to be a "common <br>
sense" measure, for now; Orpus, for instance, is trying to save the Relic, <br>
so, logically, it would be an 'As' effect if templated now, because otherwise <br>
it would wait until the Relic is discarded then bring it back and trigger all <br>
sorts of nasty little "enter play/discarded from play" effects. Terra <br>
Rebirth, however, does wait for the Creature to get booted out of play, then <br>
bring it back later...So it's not trying to save the Creature, it's just <br>
bringing a new one back into play later on, therefore losing the Guardian at <br>
the same time as the other Creature would prevent it from Rebirthing. If a <br>
Cataclysm discards them both, then no Guardian to bring it back.<br>
<br>
Now, don't consider this an 'absolute' guideline for such decisions...Just <br>
like any other ruling, go for 'common sense' when you're stuck (as a <br>
tournament judge, for instance), then bring the question up to us afterward.<br>

They are permanent as long as the card stays active; if you Interchange the <br>
Magi away or otherwise remove it from play (defeating then using Ritual <br>
Spear, for instance), then the rules for card memory will forget the changes <br>
made by the Spirits. <br>

<br>
<br>
It's something we missed; when a card says "specifically discard", it applies <br>
only to being 'discarded while it has energy'. This is the case for <br>
d'Jarvish; the answer kind of blurred the lines of intent. The answer to the <br>
question "if my Creature is defeated in an attack, is it discarded from play <br>
by an opposing card?" is yes, while the question "is it specifically <br>
discarded from play by an opposing card?" is no. Therefore, d'Jarvish's <br>
Illusions and Burrowed Creatures that are beat in a fight are lost.<br>

<br>
The difference is because Spirit of Rayje is different than the other <br>
Spirits; Spirit of Rayje is played while a Magi is still active before defeat <br>
(and therefore would suffer the frozen restriction), and the others happen <br>
after defeat. Additionally, yes, the text of most of the Spirits get around <br>
the requirement of having a Magi to play them. Finally, they were <br>
intentionally worded this way because of the problem with Spirits and defeat <br>
effects; Adis with Spirit of Arderial can quickly lead to a nasty lock, for <br>
example.<br>

Just like Climbing Staff, it should have 'as' wording, because otherwise it <br>
tries to step back in time and undo what has happened. <br>
<br>

Playtesting lended itself to Cawh's resistance to protection, and such <br>
restrictions are not made arbitrarily. Prevention vs. reduction effects are <br>
defined within the digest, and Cawh's Fearsome does "prevent prevention". <br>

Good Offense encompasses energy discard from opposing cards; this extends to <br>
Abraxin's Crown as well.<br>

One last note; these answers are not...How to put it..."Officially official"? <br>

keyword I'd like to point out is STACK. Tony being out is not in the <br>
stack, correct? The way I see it Tony can loop his power to take a <br>

give him the power. Then again, is Tony considered in the stack <br>
despite the fact hes in play?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, Tony is in the stack so he does gain "Sleep Dep". When you <br>
start the game, all three Magi are face down in the Magi Stack. As <br>
the game progresses, you flip the Magi face up, but they are still <br>
part of the Magi stack. Once every Magi in the stack is face up and <br>
defeated you lose the game. If Tony is your first Magi, he is face up <br>
while the other two Magi are face down in the Magi stack. If Tony is <br>
your last Magi, he is face up while the other two Magi are face up <br>
defeated in the Magi stack.<br>

2. if i use crushing sands on a 5e creature that's sunburned, does <br>

<br>
RT - Yes. Sunburn increases the amount of energy removed by Crushing <br>
Sands; even if this increase discards the last of the Creature's <br>
energy, the secondary effect will trigger, because the source of the <br>
total discard is still Crushing Sands. <br>
<br>

has this power). if i play crushing sands on a sunburned creature, do <br>
i get to deal 4e or 6e to my second target?<br>

as this was the amount of energy removed by the Crushing Sands.<br>

when you imbue a spell (making it a creature power), does it remain a <br>
power on the creature when the creature is discarded? (i ask because <br>
of the d'resh keeper's power)<br>
<br>
RT - No, it does not. When a Creature leaves play, all cards <br>
attached to it are discarded. Cards in the discard pile do not <br>
remember what they had attached to themselves while they were in play.<br>

RT - Sunburn creates additional energy loss from an acting source of <br>
energy removal, similar to a Scroll of Fire's Effect. Because the <br>
source of the energy loss is increased, any effect that caps that <br>

<br>
RT - Yes, you may play with any combination of those Magi; the <br>
restrictions on Yaki Core-Stalker and Sorrowing Ogar are deck <br>
construction restrictions. This means that they only forbid you from <br>
building a deck with printed Core Magi, not Magi that have the <br>
ability to become Core (because this is technically true of all non-<br>
Core Magi with Hrada in existence). Even if Sorrowing Ogar or Yaki <br>
Core-Stalker follows a League Elder or Nifer that chose Core, they <br>
don't care; at the time they "joined forces", everyone got along with <br>
everyone else, and now it's too late to get upset once they've picked <br>
a fight with another group of Magi. <br>

Prevention: Stopping the event resolution before energy removal is <br>

Reduction: When energy removal is applied has been applied, but this <br>
amount is reduced by other card effects before the energy is actually <br>

prevention.<br>

It says: Fair - Other players' cards do not use effects during <br>

I guess that fair effect only works with creatures that has effects <br>
that involve attacks. Like Pylofuf, Creatures with Invulnerability, <br>
Flutter Yup etc. Am I right or not?<br>

RT - Drajan's Effect Fair states that opposing cards cannot use <br>
Effects during attacks. This includes such things as Burrow on a <br>
Pylofuf (Creatures), Thunder Charge on a Storm Ring (Relics), and <br>
also Defense on Strag (Magi).<br>
<br>
Second:<br>
Does it involved effects on Relics like Digging Goggles, Storm Ring, <br>
Magam's Ring, Emec Forge etc.? <br>
<br>
RT - Storm Ring, Magam's Ring, Emec Forge no. Digging Goggles yes. <br>
Fair does not say during the attack step, but during attacks. <br>
Therefore if Digging Goggles enables an attack, that Effect can <br>
happen before the attack takes place to enable it.<br>
<br>
Creatures burrow should be able to attack?<br>
<br>
RT - No. As with Digging Goggles, Fair does not say during the attack <br>
step, but during attacks. As such, Creatures that cannot attack <br>
normally still may not attack because they cannot make an attempt <br>
just to stop the Burrow effect that prevents them from attacking.<br>
<br>
Third:<br>
The are other types of cards that triggers when attack like Venger, <br>
Gumph and Creatures with Weave. Does it affect this cards as well?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, no Effects at all once an attacking and defending Creature <br>
has been chosen.<br>
<br>
Gumph discard 2 energy when a creature is discard from play and <br>
Venger discard 2 energy when one of your d'resh card is attacked. <br>
Suppose that they are not involved directly in the attack. Some other <br>
creature is being attacked and also discard. Will those 2 cards where <br>
able to use their effects?<br>

RT - No. You may not use any Effects during any attack while Drajan <br>
is using Fair.<br>

I had a Seaweed Lascinth on the field, so I decided to play the Hunt <br>
(all your Weave creatures can attack twice this turn), and then <br>
played Weave Seed (add 7e to a Weave creature, and it can attack an <br>
additional time). So I had a Seaweed Lascinth out for 11e, and I had <br>
it attack three times that turn. My question is, was he supposed to <br>
attack three times, or only two times?<br>
<br>
RT - No matter the order cast, the Creature gets to attack twice as <br>
well as the ability to attack an additional time; the net result will <br>
be three either way.<br>

14. if league elder flips against sorreah, then what region is he <br>
considered to be, universal, unknown, what?<br>
<br>
RT - The League Elder would be a Universal Magi. Since Sorreah <br>
doesn't allow him to change region, he can't. Same goes for Niffer. <br>
If Niffer faces Sorreah, Niffer will be stuck as just an Arderial <br>
Magi. The reason is that the Effects are triggered when the Magi are <br>
revealed, so that even if you could use the Effects later, they have <br>
no opportunity to trigger. <br>

15. I had just built a Nar deck as was testing it against my <br>
girlfriend's revised Cald deck when we encountered the following <br>
question:<br>
<br>
I had Laranel as my Magi ("Effect - Cold Shoulder: Opponents must <br>
discard one energy from their Magi to choose Laranel or one of here <br>
creatures for a spell or power.") and my friend played B ombard <br>
("Roll a die. Discard that much energy, divided any way you choose, <br>
from up to three opposing Creatures.")<br>
<br>
The question is, does she have to pay 1 extra energy for each <br>
creature or not? B ombard doesn't say it "chooses" any creatures, so <br>
we weren't completely sure if Laranel's effect (or Glacier Hyren's <br>
Magic Resistance or Sandstone Hyren's Monolith effects) would trigger.<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, Bombard does state to choose the Creatures; it just has a <br>
seemingly unwieldy way of stating it. Laranel's Effect would require <br>
an additional energy be paid for each Creature that would be chosen.<br>
<br>
The second question comes from a later game that was Paradwyn vs <br>
Cald. Her Magi was Nara ("Effect - Resistance: All Ergars and Jiles <br>
in play that you control are unaffected by non-Cald spells.") and she <br>
had a 7e Magma Jile in play. I used Bagala Fangs to set my Hardshell <br>
Weebo's starting energy to 10, and the Magma Jile's starting energy <br>
to 1, then cast Sneak Attack ("...whenever a creature attacks or is <br>
attacked, you may have either or both creatures remove energy equal <br>
to their starting energy instead of their current energy....").<br>
<br>
Since Nara's Jile is "unaffected" by the Sneak Attack, does that mean <br>
that I can't choose how much energy the Jile removes, but I can still <br>
have my Weebo remove 10e? Or is it even worse (for me) and Sneak <br>
attack is useless in any attack involving one of Nara's Ergars or <br>
Jiles? We chose the former as the likely answer, but I was curious to <br>
get an official word.<br>
<br>
RT - Correct, the Sneak Attack may not change the amount of energy <br>
the Jile removes. You may still choose to have the Weebo remove ten, <br>
of course.<br>
<br>

16. This is a similar question to one I asked earlier. This time I <br>
have a frozen Yaw in play. It has 1e. Can I activate its power, Ice <br>
Pack, pay its last 1 energy because its frozen, then at 0 energy, <br>
return it to my hand to restore another frozen creature to its <br>
starting energy? Or does it dies immediately once I pay the 1e?<br>
<br>
RT - All costs are paid simultaneously; the energy is spent and the <br>
Yaw returned to hand before the game rules could ever register that <br>
it has zero energy. Therefore, it is not discarded, and the Power <br>
works normally.<br>

17. Do cards like Crystalize and Haunt leave play if the casting magi <br>
is defeated (precedent being the Corrupt erratta)?<br>
<br>
RT - Cyrstalize and Haunt, like Corrupt, are discarded from play when <br>
the Magi controlling them is defeated. There was no errata to <br>
Corrupt. The only exceptions to this are where it is specified <br>
otherwise on the card, such as an orphaned Creature like Trygar's <br>
Avenger and the Shadow Geysers if you have more than one in play. <br>
<br>
This situation (and another like it) came up today.<br>
<br>
Core vs Cald<br>
Cald has 2e Spark Chogo in play, has Blast Gloves and Scroll of Fire <br>
out, and has Flame Spurt attached to their Magi. Core has a 6e Dark <br>
Furok, and a 3e Wudge.<br>
<br>
Core attacks with the Dark Furok. Before the energy is removed, Cald <br>
activated the Flame Spurt and Blast Gloves to hit the Dark Furok. <br>
Dark Furok is attacking when the damage occurs, but has yet to deal <br>
damage to the Spark Chogo. Can Dark Furok's Revile trigger to deal <br>
the 2e damage to the Spark Chogo? And if so, does the Dark Furok's <br>
attack stop there because the target has left the board, or is the <br>
attack allowed to procede to the Magi?<br>
<br>
RT - You may not use Blast Gloves' Effect Flame Boost to increase the <br>
removal by the Spell Flame Spurt. Flame Boost specifies that it may <br>
only be used when a Spell is played that discards energy. Flame Spurt <br>
doesn't discard energy when it is played, it just attaches itself at <br>
that time. <br>
<br>
As for the Dark Furok, since Revile says "whenever," any time during <br>
an attack that the Dark Furok loses energy, it may Revile, not just <br>
when energy is removed normally. The discard from Revile will happen <br>
then, possibly defeating an opposing Creature before they can remove <br>
energy.<br>

18. Did anybody notice the text on undertow is divided into two <br>
sentences. So basically if somebody undertows my creature and I Umm <br>
No!, do I still have to shuffle the creature into my deck? If they <br>
undertow a Cawh, Cawh pays 6 to stop the discard, is the cawh still <br>

to shuffle the creature into the deck?<br>
<br>
RT - Treat Undertow as if it had the following text:<br>
<br>
Choose an opposing Creature. Discard the chosen Creature from play, <br>
but shuffle it into its owner's deck instead of placing it in the <br>
discard pile.<br>

So, if Undertow is prevented from discarding, then it doesn't get to <br>
shuffle the Creature anyway.<br>

19. Do cards that check for Creature defeat (like, Bungaloo, Kolte, <br>
Gia's Tome, Weaving etc.) trigger when a Creature is discarded from <br>
play during an attack, but not through the opposing Creature removing <br>
energy from it (like, Kolte...). <br>
<br>
Basically, does being "defeated" only occur when the opposing <br>
Creature removes all of the energy from your Creature?<br>
<br>
RT - As the rulebook states, a Creature is defeated when it has no <br>
energy counters remaining, regardless of how it was reduced to this <br>
state.<br>
<br>
Say my Magi was... Harresh, and I play a.. Bottled City, can I <br>
trigger Dreamdraft if I only have Nemsas in my hand? Or do I have to <br>
have one in play to trigger Dreamdraft. The wording on it is <br>
different to Bog Wellisk, and I was wondering if this was because of <br>
new templating, or different intent.<br>
<br>
RT - You may use the effect from your hand, because the effect says <br>
you can. This is no different from Wasperine or Climbing Staff.<br>
<br>
If I have Ahron as my Magi, and I play a Nemsa (through Dreamdraft or <br>
otherwise), can I dreamdraft in another Nemsa? Followed by another <br>
Nemsa?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes. Since Ahron has Nemsa as a starting card, you may play Sun <br>
Glasses followed by a Dream Drafted Nemsa because of the Sun Glasses, <br>
followed by a Dream Drafted Nemsa because of the first Nemsa, <br>
followed by a Dream Drafted Nemsa because of the second Nemsa. Though <br>
the Nemsa only allows you to Dream Draft one per starting card, this <br>
only means you cannot play a wave of them from one card; creating a <br>
domino effect of them as mentioned, however, is perfectly legal. <br>

<br>
Also, if a card like Tomes of the Great Library or Forgetten Dreams <br>

one energy. <br>
<br>
RT - The Abaquist chooses the Yaromant, discards itself and the <br>
Yaromant gains one energy, then you gain control of the Yaromant. <br>
Abaquist says to choose a Creature with less energy that itself. Then <br>
it discards itself to gain control of the chosen Creature. It does <br>
not recheck to see if the Creature gained any energy after the choice <br>
was made.<br>
<br>
there are other things that are timing issues. like ogar and <br>
greenstuff. when i play green stuff. does ogar get his roll first or <br>
does greenstuff get one energy first. <br>
<br>
RT - There are no timing issues. The active player resolves his <br>
effects first. If Green Stuff is played during your turn as the <br>
active player, your Effect adding one energy to it happens first, <br>
then Ogar gets to use her Feral Instinct. <br>
<br>
if someone would please send me a list of the steps of triggering and <br>
playing. <br>
<br>
RT - The active player processes his or her Effects until they are <br>
either done, or those Effects trigger other subsequent Effects. <br>
Subsequent Effects trigger based on their own timing, either before <br>
(AS) or after (WHEN) the Effect that it is triggering off.<br>
<br>
and one more thing. healing light. do i have to have less energy and <br>
creatures than all players or do i get to choose one to have less <br>
than. the way it is worded it can go both ways.<br>
<br>
RT - Healing Light is worded so that when you play it, as long as <br>
your Magi doesn't have the most energy and you don't have the most <br>
Creatures, you draw two cards and gain three energy.<br>

Olabra says that my creatures can't be brought below 1e by opponant's <br>

Jile in play. The jungle jiles uses its power Mass Stalk to make all <br>

does the creature lose the 1e because of the Mass Stalk or not? The <br>
Mass Stalk is a Power and Olabra should block against the 1e being <br>
removed, but at the same time the removal is triggered by the attack.<br>
<br>
RT - The Mechanic of Stalking is not a Power, even though in this <br>
case it was caused by one, so your Creatures will lose the one energy <br>
in the attack before energy is removed.<br>

<br>
Two questions:<br>
What happens if Golthub haunts an opposing creature and then Mires?<br>
<br>
RT - When you defeat Golthub, you must discard all cards that you <br>
control from play, which includes the Haunt, so nothing happens.<br>
<br>
What happens if Harror casts cataclysm after Haunting someone?<br>
<br>
RT - Since Haunt says it triggers when a Creature is discarded, it <br>
must still be in play after the Creature is discarded. Since <br>
Cataclysm discards all non-Magi cards in play, it discards the Haunt <br>
before it gets a chance to trigger. While attached cards are normally <br>
discarded with what they are attached to, they are not discarded <br>
until it's absolutely certain the card will be lost (i.e., it reaches <br>
the discard pile), then the attached card leaves play after it.<br>

Relic or uses a Power, and all actions related to that card have <br>
resolved. After playing this Spell, immediately use a Power on one of <br>
your Paradwyn cards in play. Only Paradwyn and Paradwyn Shadow Magi <br>
can play Bloom.<br>
<br>
Can Ninx use 2 Blooms in a row?<br>
<br>
RT - No. Since Bloom states "immediately after," you may not cast <br>
the second Bloom on the same trigger.<br>
<br>
Suppose that Ninx is against Barak. Barak play any relic and Ninx <br>
Stare him down leaving him in 1 energy. Then Barak move six energy <br>

creatures. The Barak play a Brushfire on one of Ninx creatures and <br>
Ninx use another Bloom to stare him down again and defeating Barak.<br>
<br>
Can she do it? I think that Bloom might let you use again the power, <br>
by the way is worded.<br>

Rabid Wasperine against Mosp As we all know the Rabid Wasperine can <br>

play a Rabid Wasperine to attack the Yark. <br>
<br>
Can he attack it or not? Since none of the Kybar creature can be <br>
attack while Mosp is in play.<br>
<br>
RT - No; the Rabid Wasperine would enter play and be unable to attack <br>
anything but a Mosp; it may only attack if it can choose the Yark as <br>

before I went and started playing with The Great Weave and such.<br>
<br>
RT - If Scyalla names a type with Pet Project, the Swirling Orshaa <br>
may change to the referenced type until the end of the turn if it is <br>
already in play. Once Pet Project has been used, it creates a game <br>
condition that no longer has a source (such as Entombing a Spell or <br>
Cleansing a card) once the Power resolves. Therefore when she plays <br>
Creatures of the chosen type, the Orsha may not change again.<br>

26. Sorry if I'm already repeating a question but I couldn't find the <br>
answer in the digests I looked through. OK, I know what specfically <br>
discarded from play means cards that directly discards creatures (ie. <br>
giant carillion, shockwave, sawgrass, etc.), but what does discarded <br>
from play mean? A lot of the new cards say whenever _ is discarded <br>
from play perform _. Does discarded from play mean discarded while it <br>
has energy by a spell like shockwave or does it mean during an <br>
attack, getting discarded by using a power (like using a core grag to <br>
active gumph's ability), or thunderquaking it to (reducing it to zero <br>
energy). the promo kt/paradwyn creature orangagan is worded well <br>
because it says discarded from play and reduced to zero energy. Am I <br>
correct in assuming that cards would be worded like the orangagan if <br>
they meant what he meant? Until I get an answer I'll just assume that <br>
discarded from play on a creature means while he has energy.<br>
<br>
RT - Discarded from play is whenever a card that is in play is moved <br>
from play to the discard pile. It doesn't have to go to the discard <br>
pile, but that is where it has to be heading after it leaves play. <br>
Some cards are worded like the Oranragan and Evil Evu to leave no <br>
doubt as to what is happening, but in the future when a card is being <br>
discarded from play, it was defeated by the card that cause it to be <br>
discarded.<br>

darkpear (darkpear@...) asks:<br>

28. Another question about Ninibom. Can you place him in any Magi <br>
stack you want as a 4th Magi, if only to throw off your opponent, or, <br>
even more importantly, as a 3rd Magi in a stack with The Dark Twins, <br>
Korg & Zet or the Brothers of Vengeance, again, to hide information <br>
about your deck before the game has begun? Just curious, since his <br>
wording seems to indicate he can be a fourth Magi in a stack and is <br>
simply unusable if the first 3 weren't Baa, Wiep and Grahnna, in that <br>
order.<br>
<br>
RT - While you may place a fourth "sleeved proxy card" (or third for <br>
dual magi), you may *not* place an actual magi card there, Ninibom or <br>
not. Just use a reverse-sleeved non-Magi Universal card. That way <br>
there is no accusation of switching around magi (at least, no more <br>
than NOT using the proxy could cause). Also, the proxy should be <br>

Or does FoS not affect unnamed Powers/Effects like Rayje's Belt? <br>

RT - Yes, the Cawh's Effects will be 'shut down', nameless or not. <br>
However, because the opponent will have a turn with all of these <br>

<br>
Power- Ice Grinder (2): Choose any one creature in play. Discard <br>

<br>
My question is as follows- When do you calculate Thast's energize <br>
rate? Lets say he starts the round with 1 yaromant in play. He <br>
energizes for 4. But then he puts out 3 more creatures during his <br>
summon phase, and they're all frozen cause of yaromant. During his <br>
2nd prs phase, he decides to use his power. Does he discard 4 (his <br>
starting energize) or 7 (his current energize)? What if he decided <br>
to flood of energy? How much would he get? <br>
<br>
RT - Thast and similar Magi (whose energize is dependant on a <br>
variable) constantly update their totals based on the modifiers in <br>
play, i.e., whenever whatever is needed to modify their energize <br>
increases or decreases (in this case, frozen Nar Creatures), then the <br>
energize rate is modified at that exact moment respectively. Whenever <br>
energize is referred to, with the rare exception of "printed <br>
energize", you always use the current value. <br>

3. This came up in a duel last week at League. <br>

Player A is using Sorreah. When Player A goes to get the starting <br>
cards for Sorreah, that player chose to get two Crushing Winds cards <br>
and a Sorreah's Dream. <br>
<br>
Player B didn't think this was correct. In addition when a ruling was <br>
made in favor of Player A, an example was given in that stated <br>
Sorreah could obtain up to three Sorreah's Dream cards if Player A <br>
had so wished. If this is correct would the Dark Twins be able to <br>
obtain two Entomb cards as part of the starting cards? <br>
<br>
What is the correct answer to this situation? <br>
<br>
RT - The ruling was correct, assuming certain things to be true. If <br>
there were two Crushing Winds in the discard pile when Sorreah was <br>
flipped, or there were no Arderial Spells at all there aside from a <br>
Sorreah's Dream, then yes, Sorreah may retrieve both copies. Sorreah <br>
does not allow you to simply go searching for Arderial Spells fom <br>
your deck or discard pile, you must try to get Arderial Spells from <br>
the discard pile first, then you may search the deck if the pile runs <br>
out before the starting cards are all retrieved. And though it is <br>
possible to retrieve three Sorreah's Dreams with Sorreah, the <br>
circumstances for it, unless Sorreah is the first Magi, are very <br>
unlikely. However, the Dark Twins are very likely to retrieve two <br>
Entombs, if they wish, as they would most likely be the first <br>
choosing starting cards. <br>

would the kt player pay which of the following to use the hyrens <br>

wrong) <br>
-he pays one because the power is only activated once but chooses <br>

- he pays nothing because he is not choosing one creature he is <br>

it affects the cost of whatever needs to choose), and not the Magi. <br>

-timing question <br>
Situation: creature such as ormagon or player playing boil. <br>
-with current timing rulings (i believe I need to see them again I <br>
accidently deleted them) you can not use abwynns quill on either am I <br>
correct? because the quill is a when effect triggering after the <br>
ormagon or boil has been resolved. <br>
<br>
RT - Overwrite is an 'As' effect, and works in either situation. <br>
<br>
follow up question <br>
- if wording is change to allow for the quill to affect these thing <br>
it would then be an as effect which would then allow for the quill to <br>
affect cataclysm as it is played because the may not be affected by <br>
opposing cards is a when play taking effect after as effects allowing <br>
you to quill it and basically discard your opponenets hand. <br>

point during its resolution. Period. <br>

5. Does the discard pile have to stay in the same order as the cards <br>
are placed into it considering the fact not everyone is going to use <br>
cards like Twee? <br>
<br>
RT - The order of the discard pile cannot be changed as a player <br>
wishes;only if a card is removed from it or if you are specifically <br>
instructed to change the order can the order change. As a side note, <br>
whenever multiple cards are discarded simultaneously, their owner <br>
chooses the final order in which the cards will arrive (so in the <br>
case of a Twee, they may choose to put their best Creature just <br>
beneath it for returning). <br>

<br>
A. Is Yaki, Core Stalker considered to be a shadow magi? I said no, <br>
but was argued that he should be as he can play Core cards. <br>
<br>
RT - No; he is not a Shadow Magi, nor is Sorrowing Ogar. Being able <br>
to play cards of a region does not give any other mechanical <br>
associations with that region. <br>
<br>
B. Rock Silth's 1st effect says: <br>
<br>
Effect - Hide: If an opposing Spell or Power discards Rock Silth from <br>
play, move energy up to Rock Silth's starting energy from it to your <br>
Magi and draw a card. <br>
<br>
The question arose from this situation. Player A has 3 energy on <br>
Rock Silth. Player B plays Crushing Fungus on Rock Silth. Would <br>
this trigger Hide? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, it would; there would be zero energy to move, but its <br>
controller would still get to draw a card. <br>

plays Shadow Cloak and uses its effect. Turn 2: Player B in his turn <br>
discards Shadow Cloak. Turn 3: Player A plays a second Shadow Cloak <br>
from their hand. Since cards dont have memory, but the Power of the <br>
first Shadow Cloak is still in play. Can Player A use the Shadow <br>
Cloaks Power in this new round? If so, can Player A discard their <br>
own Shadow Cloak from play in Turn 3 and then play a second Shadow <br>
Cloak, thus creating a two turn Shadow cloak power? <br>
<br>
RT - The following is an official clarification to the text of Shadow <br>
Cloak as, mechanically speaking, the last line of the current text is <br>
nonsense: <br>

Shadow Cloak <br>
Core Relic <br>
Cost: 0 <br>
Power - Protection (2): Each of your Core Creatures currently in play <br>
cannot be affected by non-Core Spells and Powers until the end of <br>
your next turn. You may not use Protection during your next turn. <br>
<br>
Just like Hood of Hiding, Shadow Cloak creates a 'Lockdown'-style <br>
effect that prevents you from using Powers named Protection on cards <br>
named Shadow Cloak during your next turn. However, as this is part of <br>
Protection's ongoing effect, if the ongoing effects of the Power are <br>
removed (such as by Beam of Light), you also regain the ability to <br>
play a new Shadow Cloak and use Protection during your next turn. <br>

energy because Enflame is enhanced by The Last Words. Then they both <br>
lose another 3 energy because Enflame discards "one energy from each <br>
Orothe Creature" enhanced by the Last Words. <br>

before the attack damage comes off?<br>
<br>
RT - 'When' effects happen after the action that triggers them resolves; in <br>
this case, after the attack resolution, but before you can begin another <br>
attack. Therefore, the Spell is played after the attack ends, so that would <br>
also be after energy is removed; this is to help prevent some of the sticky <br>
timing situations that playing certain Spells in the middle of an attack <br>
could cause. <br>

"You may play this card as an opposing card discards all of the <br>
energy from your magi. Add three energy to your magi. This card can <br>
prevent your magi from being defeated. You can only play Spirit of <br>
Rayje three times per game."<br>
<br>
The problem right now is it says "You may play this card", not "you <br>
may [b]only[/b] play this card", and people on the boards are <br>
interpreting this to mean that in addition to playing it "as an <br>
opposing card discards all the energy from your magi" you can also <br>
play it on your turn to simply add three energy to your magi. I'm <br>
REALLY hoping this is not how it was intended to be worded; a free <br>
three energy would be crazy. <br>
<br>
RT - Spirit of Rayje should be templated like the others, and may 'only' be <br>
played when the condition of losing all of the energy from an opposing card <br>
is met; this condition is not an additional means of playing it, it is the <br>
only means.<br>

8. Alaban reads:<br>

This would seem to circumvent Cawh's anti return to hand ability <br>
because the return effect is not keyed to the discard all energy <br>

clarified to read <br>
the effects related to the return power are negated, otherwise in the <br>

<br>
RT - The part of 'discard the chosen Creature's energy' on Alaban's Undream <br>
Power is extraneous reminder text, and should be ignored for the most part, <br>
because the rules for card memory will automatically remove the energy <br>
counters from play. The text is there mainly because, without it, there would <br>
be some beginning players that try to find a place to put the energy. Cawh <br>
ignores Undream just like it would any other 'return to hand' effect.<br>

1) Can Frost Raxis choose a non-discardable relic as the target of <br>
its power if the player has other, discardable, relics in play?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, a normally non-discardable Relic may be chosen, even if there are <br>
other moare valid targets.<br>

2) Can Frost Raxis choose a non-discardable relic in play if its the <br>
only relic in play? Does it get discarded?<br>
<br>
RT - The Relic may be chosen, but it's not discarded.<br>
<br>
If the non-discardable relic can be choosen in either instance is <br>
this the way around its "cannot be discarded" ability? As it not a <br>
specific discard but rather an indirect discard as the opponent <br>
chooses what relic to destroy.<br>
<br>
RT - Though the opponent is allowed to choose what is discarded, Thermal <br>
Stress is still the source of the discard effect; this means that if the <br>
Relic the opponent chooses cannot be discarded by opposing cards, it ignores <br>
Thermal Stress's discard effect. Additionally, because Thermal Stress needs <br>
to reference a Relic that was actually discarded from play by the Power, not <br>
just a Relic that was attempted to be discarded by it, even if the opponent <br>
tries (and fails) to discard one of these 'legendary' Relics, the Raxis will <br>
not gain the energy from using Thermal Stress if the Relic's not the one you <br>
chose.<br>

10. You have in play a Giant Carillion and a K'Teeb Cub with 4e on it. <br>
Your opponent is playing Nar and Frozen all creatures in play. You <br>
use K'Teeb Cub's power, which under un-Frozen conditions would allow <br>
the Giant Carillion to use its power for free. However, since all <br>
creatures are Frozen, does the Giant Carillion have to spend 1e for <br>
using its power?<br>
<br>
RT - The Power would cost one energy to use; though the K'Teeb Cub reduces <br>
the cost of Stomp to zero, the cost modifier by frozen isn't inclusive with <br>
the Power cost; instead, of "X (base cost) + 1 = Y (total cost)", frozen <br>
modifiers make "X + 1 = X + 1". Therefore, even if you remove X, the base <br>
cost, the one energy penalty from being frozen still exists. <br>
<br>
(The modifications of a status aren't valued by who causes it; additionally, <br>
ruling based on timing of who used it would create a scenario whereas <br>
freezing your own cards would allow you to undo the frozen penalty.)<br>

incidently" has an energize of 10+), would she still be an Orothe <br>
Shadow Magi? Or does she count as a new Magi altogether once <br>
revealed and, therefore, is a pure (and wholesome) Orothe Magi once <br>
again?<br>

RT - M'Rika would 'forget' that she is a Shadow Magi and when she enters play <br>
again, she will be purely Orothe (and in a lot of trouble if she has no cards <br>

Shadow Magi of the region named. If you applied Possession first, then Niffer <br>

Defense in the attack with the other Korrit. Additionally, the Korrits would <br>
lose no energy in the attack; though they resolve their defense separately, <br>

pointed out that Core Magi and Shadow Magi are actually two different <br>
types of Magi. Two cards he uses to back up this argument are <br>
Crushing Darkness ("Shadow Magi may not play this card") and Shadow <br>
Ritual ("Only Shadow Magi may play Shadow Ritual").<br>
<br>
RT - A Core Magi as printed is any Magi with the words 'Core' or 'Shadow <br>
Magi' in their title boxes. If a Magi cannot be in a stack with a Core Magi, <br>
then neither Magi of this type can be placed with them.<br>

ANNOUNCEMENT <br>
<br>
The Rules Team requests that no more rules questions be submitted in the form <br>
of "fiction". Questions not asked in the form of game mechanics cannot be <br>
answered. <br>
<br>
Additionally, questions asking if a ruling is "still true" or if a ruling has <br>
been reversed will not be answered, either; the rules team maintains an <br>
archive of rules digests to answer these questions, and being hindered by <br>
these slows down the digest creation process as well. <br>

1. First If I have two torpars in play if someone plays wildfire against me <br>
and I have three creatures in play do they both lose six or does one lose six <br>
being of my choice because of which effect to resolve? <br>
<br>
RT - You would choose the order in which the Torpars activate and take the <br>
energy loss from all of your Creatures onto themselves; the first one you <br>
choose to resolve will redirect all of the energy loss to all of your <br>
Creatures from the Wildfire to it, then the second Torpar's Effect will <br>
resolve and direct all of the loss to itself instead. <br>

2. Zajan <br>
<br>
Effect - Sleep All Day: Zajan draw two cards during the energize <br>
step. Zajan does not draw cards as normal during the draw step. <br>
<br>
<br>
Ebony Mirror <br>
<br>
Effect - Grim Reflection: At the beginning of each player's draw <br>
step, if that player has more cards in his or her hand than any <br>
other player, that player draws one less card this turn. While Ebony <br>
Mirror is in play, all players draw at least one card during their <br>
draw step. <br>
<br>
<br>
Warrada's Ring <br>
<br>
Effect - Phenomenal Cosmic Power: At the beginning of each of your <br>
turns, choose either to draw an additional card at the end of the <br>
turn, or to have all of your Core cards cost one less energy to <br>
play, to a minimum of one, until the end of the turn. <br>
<br>
<br>
This cards combo may work. If Zajan is after the Dark Twins or <br>
Nagsis he will be able to play Ebony Mirror and Warrada's Ring. <br>
<br>
Zajan Draw in his energize step, but his effects doesn't change the <br>
step. So we think that with Ebony Mirror in play Zajan will have to <br>
draw at least 1 card during his draw step, so if Warrada's Ring is <br>
also in play he may draw an additional card if the opponent has more <br>
cards in hand, of course. Am I right or not? <br>
<br>
So Zajan will be quite good. Draws 2 cards at energize step and draw <br>
to more at draw step, plus his energize. <br>
<br>
RT - The Mirror cannot restrict the ability to draw a card from Warrada's <br>
Ring; the card is drawn at the end of turn, not during the Draw step, and the <br>
Mirror only affects cards drawn during the Draw step. The Mirror will also <br>
allow Zajan to draw one card during the Draw step, in addition to his two <br>
during the Energize step. <br>

3. Can a Karak or Tidal Karak take control of a legendary relic such as <br>
Tomes of the Great Library, Kybar's Fang, and Key to the Vault of <br>
Knowledge? I forgot the name of the overpowered Weave one. <br>
If the Karak/Tidal Karak can seize the legendary relic, would that <br>
count for the effect that discards it from play if the magi is not <br>
________ ? <br>
This question is not about Orothe magi taking control of opposing <br>
relics so much as it is about denying the opponent use of that <br>
relic. Well, it's about taking control of relics for the purposes of <br>
Corothan and and Karak Band/Necklace as well, I guess. <br>
<br>
RT - Karak does change controllers, Tidal Karak does not; the Tidal Karak <br>
plays the Relic from the discard pile, meaning you always control it. <br>
However, because each of these Relics require your Magi to be of an <br>
appropriate region, then your Magi must still match that region or the Relic <br>
is immediately discarded. <br>

4. A: If I am usnig Lasada and he gets defeated, if I play a Spirit of <br>
Arderial, can I reshuffle, then draw 3 or am I forced to draw 3 <br>
before the reshuffling? <br>
<br>
RT - All defeat effects are processed before Spirit cards are played; Lasada <br>
would draw three and Adis would discard three before the Spirit were used.<br>
<br>
B: If Niffer still has 2 energy while Risha is using Prophecy, can she <br>
Overwrite a Spirit of Naroom to change Eternal Vigor to "Whenever one of your <br>
Arderial Creatures..."? Likewise with Spirit of Paradwyn or Spirit of the <br>
Core. <br>
<br>
RT - No; Spirit Spells are played once the Magi leaves play, and so there <br>
will be no Niffer to Overwrite it. Though you may not normally play cards <br>
without an active Magi, the Spirit Spells are an exception, as long as you <br>
can still pay the costs for it.<br>
<br>

Mike (mont1983@...) writes: <br>

5. Overwrite now says that it can only be used once per turn. If I have <br>
Niffer and an Abwyn's Quill in play, can I use each Overwrite once <br>
per turn, or am I limited to one usage period? <br>
<br>
RT - Because neither Overwrite uses the phrase "you may only use Overwrite<br>
once per turn", then it is only referring to the use of that Effect on that <br>
Relic; Niffer is still free to use hers. Additionally, if you removed your <br>
Quill from play the same turn after using Overwrite and played it again, the <br>
'new' Quill would also be able to use its Overwrite. <br>

6. Does Flameplate cancel the original damage source and introduce it's <br>
own, or does it merely redirect the damage, in which case the damage <br>
wouldn't be originating from "an opposing card"? <br>
<br>
RT - Flameplate Armor does not change the source of the removal with the <br>
Effect "Good Offense"; this means that the opponent will not be able to use <br>
their own effects that occur "when an opposing card" removes energy from them <br>
(though all effects triggered by them removing energy in the situation still <br>
apply). <br>

---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS <br>
<br>
Cawh <br>
(First Nameless Effect): If Cawh is discarded or returned to your hand by an <br>
opposing card while it has energy, discard six energy from Cawh instead. <br>
Opposing cards cannot make Cawh change controllers. <br>
<br>
Reasoning: Your cards should be able to give control of Cawh to the opponent, <br>
as this is usually part of the penalty for playing with such cards.<br>
<br>
Sikra <br>
d'Resh Creature - Illusion <br>
Effect - Illusionary is instead Effect: (Nameless). <br>
<br>
Reasoning: Sikra now follows the template of all other Illusions.<br>
<br>
Togoth<br>
Effect - Darkest Magics: The first time Togoth energizes after he is <br>
revealed, play one Shadow Geyser from your hand ignoring all costs and <br>
requirements. If Togoth is the first Magi in your stack, you may not choose <br>
to play first. <br>
<br>
Reasoning: Togoth should not be able to play multiple Shadow Geysers if he is <br>
able to energize multiple times on his first turn. Similarly, the opponent <br>
should not be able to negate his ability by choosing to let him play first <br>
and not energize.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
1. Koil: Effect - Nightmare: When you play Koil, choose any one Creature in <br>
play. Discard one energy from the chosen Creature. <br>
Does Koil count as being a 'creature in play' if it is the first creature <br>
played when there are no other creatures on table? Basically, can you please<br>
clarify whether Nightmare is triggered when you declare that you are playing <br>
Koil or after it's on the table and a valid target for 'creature in play'? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, Koil is eligible for Nightmare; if he's the only Creature in play, <br>
he loses one energy. <br>
<br>
Grahnna: Effect - Share: Whenever you play a Bograth Creature, choose any <br>
one Bograth Creature in play. Add one energy to the chosen Creature. <br>
Similar situation to the above question; can Grahnna use Share to add 1 <br>
energy to the first creature he plays? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; once the Bograth Creature enters play, you choose who will receive<br>
the Share bonus. IT may be the Creature you just played. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
2. Do two Choguses in play cancel out each other's Effect? <br>
<br>
RT - No; they both have the same effect on the text of the cards they apply <br>
to, and so the end result when their effects are applied will be the same. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
3. Ullig's Darge attacks Traveling Healer who has a Flameplate Armor. <br>
He discard it in to order to prevent the damage from the Darge and <br>
also remove the 7 energy to Ullig instead. Ullig use a Climbing <br>
Staff to protect herself. <br>
<br>
Can she use it? The Flameplate Armor is the one discarding energy? <br>
Or is the Darge who's energy remove was deflected? Because if Darge <br>
is the source then the Climbing Staff shouldn't work since it was <br>
energy remove from an attack and not a spell, power or effect. <br>
<br>
RT - No; Good Offense does not change the source of the energy removal, and <br>
so Climbing Staff cannot be used because the removal is not being caused by <br>
an opposing card. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
4. Shattershards (Nar Spell) 1e, Choose a Magi. Discard one of the <br>
Magi's Relics. Remove Energy from one of that Magi's Creatures equal <br>
to the Relic's Cost, plus two. <br>
<br>
Barquas Bubble (Orothe Relic) 2e. Effect-Cover: Whenever an opposing <br>
Spell or Power affects one of your Creatures in play, as it does you <br>
may shuffle Barqua's Bubble into your deck and discard one energy <br>
from your Magi. If you do, the Spell or Power does not affect the <br>
Creature. <br>
<br>
Question: Cast Shattershards, choose bubble, does the player get to <br>
use the Effect Cover to protect his creature or is the bubble <br>
discarded before that happens? <br>
<br>
RT - No; Shattershards does not affect the Creature until after the Bubble is <br>
discarded from play. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
5. I don't know if this has been asked but if an opponent collects 15 <br>
doom counters on Sphere and does not use it on the same turn can Koza <br>
who is the opposing player activate the Sphere's power and discard <br>
the opposing players creatures. <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, he may. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
6.A) Does the KT Spell 'Ascend' affect creatures that weren't in play when <br>
it <br>
was cast? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Ascend is not concerned with what was in play when it is cast, only <br>
what is in play during its duration. <br>
<br>
B) If a power on a card has no cost (Tiller's Scrounge or Exchange, Crystal <br>
Arboll if that card type is frozen, does it then cost 1? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; frozen cards have Power cost equal to base cost +1, even if that <br>
base cost is zero. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
7. Sagawal <br>
says "when an opposing spell is discarding only one of your other <br>
Kybar's Teeth creatures from play, you may discard Sagawal from play <br>
instead." <br>
Most people think of Sagawal as the little guy that "takes <br>
shockwaves for the team." But the wording does not limit it's <br>
Watchful effect to direct discard spells like Shockwave, Tidal Wave, <br>
and Chill of the Night. Dessicate is also a spell that can discard a <br>
creature from play. My question is this: if my opponent uses a <br>
Crushing ______ on my 4e creature, and I choose to have my Sagawal <br>
sacrifice itself from play to save my other creature (say it was a <br>
Giant Balder I wanted to use Dream Balm on) does that cancel out the <br>
effect of the Crushing spell? <br>
Crushing Spells say "Choose any one creature in play. Discard four <br>
energy from the chosen creature. If this discards the chosen <br>
creature from play, _________." Obviously, the Sagawal was not the <br>
chosen creature discarded from play. <br>
<br>
RT - The Sagawal may be discarded when one of your Creatures is reduced to <br>
zero energy by a Spell, "instead" of the Creature; however, the Creature will <br>
still be a zero energy Creature, and be discarded anyway. BUT, the source of<br>
this discard will then be the game rules, and not the card effect that <br>
reduced the Creature to zero energy. So, while it would generally be a waste <br>
to discard Sagawal when another Creature is reduced to zero energy and <br>
discarded, it will "erase" the effects of the Crushing Spell (or any card <br>
with a similar 'if this effect discards the chosen Creature from play') and <br>
keep your opponent from getting the secondary benefit. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
8. Avatar's staff says "your magi may not be defeated while you have <br>
illusions in play." Normally, a magi with zero energy and only illusions in <br>
play is defeated unless they are Kyg'n. Avatar's staff makes those illusions <br>
count as being in play for the magi when checking to see if they are <br>
defeated. BUT the way the staff is worded now, the magi may not be defeated<br>
while they have illusions in play. Period. Am I undefeatable with the <br>
Avatar's Staff and illusions in play? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, if you control an Illusion and have Subjective Reality in effect, <br>
your Magi are immune to effects that would automatically defeat them, such as <br>
Trug's Cataclysm or Awakening. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
9. If a Korrit Pack Hunts with a Rabid Bisiwog, do both of the defending <br>
creatures also receive Pack Hunt damage, or does only one Defending <br>
creature receive the Pack Hunt damage? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; because the Rabid Bisiwog regards the attack as only one attack, <br>
then Pack Hunt will increase the energy removed from all defenders. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
10. The first effect of Shivara: Loyalty (Whenever one of your Creatures <br>
is discarded from play by an opposing Spell, instead return that <br>
Creatures to it's owner's hand). <br>
<br>
If one of Shivara's Creature is reduced to zero energy <br>
by a Remove Energy Spell (like Fireball), that Creature's return to <br>
the owner's hand? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, it would, because it was discarded from play by an opposing Spell. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
11. A) Will Emaal's "Sabotage" effect trigger the Flameplate Armor? ie. <br>
can you use the Flameplate Armor's "Good Offense" to stop it. <br>
Problem being that when Sabotage is triggered, Emaal has already been <br>
defeated, so technically there is no "Opposing Magi" for the Armor to <br>
target. <br>
<br>
RT - The end result will be the source effect (Sabotage) trying to discard <br>
energy from a target that has become invalidated, and so no energy is <br>
removed; because Good Offense doesn't explicitly "choose" the defending Magi <br>
to have the source card remove energy from, it can redirect the removal, even <br>
if there is no Magi to take the loss. <br>
<br>
B) Has there been/Will there be any errata to Sikra's Illusionary <br>
effect to change it to be like the other Illusions (unnamed), or do <br>
we treat it as is, a named effect (that can be belted)? If there <br>
will be no change, will it still be counted as an Illusion (for such <br>
things like Avatar's Staff)? What arguement can be made to justify <br>
that? It's effect is named "Illusionary", not Illusion, and it does <br>
not have the catch phrase "Illusion" in it's title. <br>
<br>
RT - Sikra should be treated as if its Illusionary Effect is nameless and it <br>
has the word 'Illusion' in its Region box. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
12. I was playing against Paradwyn today and my opponent play a Liriel's <br>
Cape and the play a Jungle Hyren. He says that he could play the <br>
Jungle Hyren with 5 more energy, 2 for the Hyren effect and 3 for <br>
the Cape (paying it of course). I said that he could not do that. <br>
Who's right and why? <br>
<br>
RT - You were correct; the Jungle Hyren could not gain the benefits of <br>
Liriel's Cape or its own Dreamwarp ability, because Liriel's Cape only <br>
affects Creatures in play (and a Creature is not in play at the point you <br>
would pay Dreamwarping changes), and the Jungle Hyren has to be in play in<br>
order to use its version of the Dreamwarp Effect (and it is not in play to <br>
use the Effect while it is being played). <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
13. What happens at the end of the turn when Arosa has a Cawh in play? <br>
Can you process Shell Game at all? If you do, what happens? Can you <br>
gain control of opposing creatures? Will Cawh remain under your <br>
control if you use Shell Game? <br>
<br>
RT - Treat Cawh as if he had the following: <br>
<br>
Cawh <br>
(First Nameless Effect): If Cawh is discarded or returned to your hand by an <br>
opposing card while it has energy, discard six energy from Cawh instead. <br>
Opposing cards cannot make Cawh change controllers. <br>
<br>
The opponent would receive Cawh, but you would not receive it back later <br>
(because Arosa would then be an opposing card trying to take control of Cawh).<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
14. A. Scyalla starts with any 2 different creatures of the same type. <br>
Is there an official list of "creature types" that can be used to <br>
prove the legality of getting creatures? <br>
<br>
RT - Any single word (ignoring plurality) in a Creature's name is a valid <br>
Creature type. <br>
<br>
B. On the same note: What happens if I have Sorreah in play and play <br>
a warlum to fetch a Ythra's mantle and play it. What starting cards <br>
do i search for, any spell? The same goes for the Dresh Spell <br>
Redream. Also what if I am playing Scyalla or Quilla? <br>
<br>
RT - You could not play the Mantle, because Sorreah is an Arderial Magi and <br>
it is a d'Resh Relic. In the case of Redream, Sorreah would only be able to <br>
take a Sorreah's Dream, and Scyalla would only be able to take a Weave <br>
Powder, because these are the only printed starting cards they have. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
15. I read in a previous Rules Digest that a frozen magi would not be <br>
able to play a Spirit card when defeated since they would not be <br>
able to pay the additional energy. I find this confusing due to the <br>
timing word "when." Since it seems you can only play this spell <br>
after your magi has been defeated (and the defeat has been resolved) <br>
you would have no magi in play. If you have no magi in play then <br>
you would not have a frozen magi, and would not have to pay an <br>
additional energy. <br>
<br>
RT - The only Spirit Spell that cannot be played by a frozen Magi is Spirit <br>
of Rayje, because it is played before the Magi leaves play. You are correct <br>
about the other Spirits, though, there is no Magi to be frozen. <br>
<br>
I also read that a non-Core magi would not be able to cast a Spirit <br>
spell that had been chosen by Entomb (and, by extension, a Core magi <br>
would not be able to cast Spirit of the Core if it had been chosen <br>
by Cleansing). I find this confusing, also because of the timing <br>
word "when." If there is no magi in play it would seem that there <br>
would be no magi to check for regional penalties and restrictions. <br>
<br>
RT - Technically speaking, playing a Spirit Spell ignores regional <br>
restrictions, because there is no Magi playing it (these are the ONLY cards <br>
currently that can be played without an active Magi, and having a zero cost <br>
means you can pay the zero energy to play them). A Core Magi could not play <br>
an Entombed Spirit of Arderial when they're defeated, because the Spirit <br>
requires an Arderial Magi be defeated, not the Magi of the Spell's region; <br>
but, a Cleansed Spirit of the Core could be played when a Core Magi is <br>
defeated, because its requirement is that a Core Magi be defeated, and there <br>
are no regional penalties to come into play. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
16. The current rulings state that a magi may only have one Dream <br>
Channel and one Nightmare Channel focused on them. This is to <br>
prevent broken combos and locks. But can a magi cast two Dream <br>
Channel or two Nightmare CHannel with only one actually taking <br>
effect and the other just attached as a 'backup' spell? <br>
One might do this for the purposes of diverting Beam of Light. If <br>
both Channel spells are targeted, that means that Beam of Light can <br>
not discard a small creature or relic. The other reason one would do <br>
this is if one is in a multi player game. Let's say player A is not <br>
liked by playrs B, C, D, and E. They choose four different creatures <br>
and attach four different Nightmare channels to insure that Player A <br>
has one affecting them for a long time to come. <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; any additional Nightmare Channels or Dream Channels played will <br>
remain 'dormant' until the first one played stops affecting the chosen Magi; <br>
then, the next one that was played that had chosen the Magi will begin <br>
affecting it. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
17. If a Zungg or Gwaeg is Cleansed into dual region Bograth/Kybar's <br>
Teeth or Bograth/Underneath creatures, are they still unplayable by <br>
magi that are not Bograth or Core? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Cleansing a Creature that states only Magi of certain regions may <br>
play it does not affect who can play it; even Magi of the new, cleansed <br>
region will not gain the ability to play the card. <br>
<br>
What about Grej and Prek? Can they use their Kinship effects to play <br>
the Cleansed creatures without restriction or penalty? <br>
<br>
RT - In most cases; but in the case of a Creature such as Zungg, the ability <br>
for only Core and Bograth Magi to be able to play it is not a regional <br>
restriction, so Grej and Prek still cannot use them. <br>
<br>
If I was a non-Core magi and took control of a Glabit (say Anarchy <br>
or Abaquist or I Cleanse or Urhail or Mantle of Shadows Corrupt) and <br>
make all my Bograth creatures also Core (or Core/Bograth/Paradwyn in <br>
the case of things like Treepsh, N'kala, Mydra, etc) can I then use <br>
Cleanse to make those Creatures Kybar's Teeth/Bograth/Paradwyn or <br>
Underneath/Bograth/Paradwyn for the remainder of the game? <br>
<br>
RT - You may only Cleanse a card that is printed as Core, not a card that is <br>
put into play and then becomes Core by another card effect. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
18. In a previous RD the RT stated that the d'Resh spell Redream would <br>
pull nothing for Rayje and only the Staff of Hyren for Yerthe. <br>
Could you explain why they couldn't pull Rayje's Construct and Weave <br>
Powder, respectively? <br>
<br>
RT - It was a simple matter of forgetting those cards (because we only <br>
checked the cards in question). Rayje would be able to get his Construct and<br>
Yerthe would get the Weave Powder. <br>
<br>
If you can't Redream the above cards, does that mean they would be <br>
unaffected by Spirit of Orothe? <br>
<br>
RT - Spirit of Orothe replaces the STARTING line in its entirety, including <br>
cards that are there but aren't printed there (cards with "STARTING: Magi <br>
Name" on them). <br>

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS <br>
<br>
Sikra <br>
In the previous rules Digest, Sikra was listed as a d’Resh Creature instead <br>
of a d’Resh/Underneath Creature. This was NOT a change; Sikra is still a d’<br>
Resh/Underneath Creature. <br>
<br>
Thresh <br>
Effect – Rethresh: Whenever… <br>
<br>
Reasoning: Thresh is misprinted. Rethresh is an Effect, not a Power. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
ERRATA (Legal 03/15/03) <br>
<br>
Will of Orothe <br>
Orothe Spell <br>
6 <br>
Attach Will of Orothe to an opposing Magi. If Will of Orothe is still <br>
attached during that Magi's Attack step, you choose whether or not that <br>
Magi's Creatures attack and which Creatures they attack. A Creature may not <br>
attack another Creature controlled by the same player. Discard Will of Orothe<br>
at the beginning of your next turn. <br>
<br>
Reasoning: The Will/Entangle Spell combination has long been a stalling <br>
standard of the unfair combo decks that have been the primary sources of <br>
abuse in Magi-Nation DUEL. The main cause of that abuse was the fact that, as <br>
both Will and Entangle affect the opponent and not their Magi, the <br>
suppression caused by Will of Orothe was unduly unstoppable. These changes <br>
not only align the card more to modern design intent, affecting a Magi and <br>
not the player, as well as making the Spell linger to have a chance of being <br>
dispelled.<br>
<br>
Blizzard Core <br>
Nar Relic <br>
5 <br>
Effect - Coriolis: At the beginning of your Energize step, before you <br>
energize, choose a Magi. If that Magi has no Creatures in play and your Magi<br>
has more energy than the chosen Magi's starting energy, discard Blizzard Core <br>
and defeat the chosen Magi. <br>
<br>
Reasoning: This change is based on some last-minute playtest suggestions to <br>
Blizzard Core that were unable to be implemented at the time of printing. The <br>
card was never intended to be used with Perpetual Motion, and a Magi using <br>
the Blizzard Core should not receive the energy bonus for the turn to almost <br>
certainly seal their chances of success. <br>
<br>
Creeping Chill <br>
Bograth/Kybar's Teeth Spell <br>
2 <br>
Until the end of your next turn, as one of your Kybar's Teeth Creatures is <br>
attacked, it gains three energy if you control at least one Bograth Creature <br>
and as one of your Bograth Creatures attacks, it gains three energy if you <br>
control at least one Kybar's Teeth Creature. <br>
<br>
Reasoning: Because of unfair abuse with Overwrite-style abilities, players <br>
were able to intentionally misuse Creeping Chill to the detriment of their <br>
environment. This change to the Spell enables it to continue being a combat <br>
booster for Bograth/Kybar's Teeth decks, but not in a way that can be overly <br>
abused. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
1. Can I use the belt to lock down the unnamed effect that prevents one of my<br>
illusions from attacking a Magi directly as well as keeping me from being <br>
defeated if my illusion is in play and I have no other creatures or energy on <br>
my magi? <br>
<br>
RT - No. Rayje’s Belt says to name a Power or Effect on a card in play. <br>
Effects without a name cannot be named. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
2. Does Drajan's ability to negate Effects during attacks prevent Yaki from <br>
allowing his creatures to attack twice per turn? <br>
<br>
RT - No, Drajan’s Effect prevents the use of Effects that occur during/in an <br>
attack/attacks, but not Effects that occur outside of attacks (such as Yaki's <br>
Double Strike). <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
3. Would Flutteryups Dodge, which makes it lose no energy in the attack if a <br>
creature with more than 3 energy was involved in the attack, keep it from <br>
losing the additional energy from it being stalked (which seems to be part of <br>
the attack)? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, if the conditions for Dodge are met, the Flutter Yup will lose no <br>
energy during that attack. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
4. Dessicate removes all energy from a creature, which would cause it to be <br>
discarded specifically, could Umm...no be used to prevent the creature from <br>
being discarded? Or is Umm...no specific to cards that say "Discard the <br>
chosen creature/card/etc."? <br>
<br>
RT - The phrases "specifically discard a Creature" should be read in all <br>
cases as "discard a Creature while it has energy." The word "specifically" is <br>
now obsolete, and is not used on cards anymore. Desiccate discards the <br>
Creature when it has no energy – "Ummm… NO!" cannot be played to save the <br>
Creature. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
5. If Sarazen Outcast's Favored Enemy is D'Resh (or Kybar's Teeth) and it <br>
attacks a Sandstone Hyren, which has Super Invulnerability (loses two less <br>
energy from attacks and loses no energy from effects during any player's <br>
attack), would it lose any energy from the Sarazen Outcasts effect Bane (add<br>
four energy before energy is removed when in an attack with it's Favored <br>
Enemy)? Example: Sarazen Outcast is at 3 energy, Sandstone Hyren is at 9.<br>
Would the SC end the battle dead, having done 5 total damage to the SH or <br>
just 1? <br>
<br>
RT - Sarazen Outcast’s Effect does not do anything to any other Creatures. <br>
The Outcast in your example would attack, gaining four energy, and would be<br>
then at seven energy. Combat between the two Creatures is handled normally. <br>
In the example, it would remove five energy (7 – 2) from the Hyren, and the <br>
Hyren would remove nine energy from the Outcast (defeating it). <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
6. Unmake refers to doing 1 damage to each creature of the same type as the <br>
one that was just unmade, does that mean region or named creatures? Example: <br>
I Unmake a Balamant, do all Naroom creatures in play lose one energy or all <br>
Balamants in play lose 1 energy? <br>
<br>
RT - A Creature type is any one whole word in a Creature’s Name, ignoring <br>
plurals. This is different from Regions, which are found on a Creature’s <br>
subtitle. For example, if a Balamant Pup were chosen as the target for <br>
Unmake, all Balamants and all Pups would lose one energy after the chosen <br>
creature was discarded (another Balamant Pup would only lose one energy, not <br>
two for sharing more than one type).<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
7. A. Can brushfire be played from the discard pile during your opponent’s <br>
turn? If so when can you use its effect? i.e. any time during your opponents <br>
turn or just during your opponents S/P/R phase or what?<br>
<br>
RT - The way to play Brushfire is to treat it as if it were in your hand. You <br>
play it the same way whether it is in your hand or discard pile. You can <br>
normally only a Brushfire in your hand on your turn, and during a PRS step. <br>
The same is true for a Brushfire in the discard pile (note that cards like <br>
Good Ol’ Ashgar allow you to break this rule). <br>
<br>
B. When played from the discard pile can its cost be reduced by other S/P/R's <br>
(such as Robe of the Ages)? When played from the discard pile can its damage <br>
be enhanced by other S/P/R's (like Scroll of Fire)? <br>
<br>
RT - Robes of the Ages and Scroll of Fire (and other cards) affect Brushfire <br>
when you play it from your hand, and so they do the same when you play <br>
Brushfire from the discard pile. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
8. Sunburn while paying cost for a power… Does it lose two additional energy? <br>
I didn't think so at first but, then I read the glossary in the rulebook from <br>
Fall 2002. Power states, 'Pay all cost associated with that power such as <br>
\ENERGY LOSS\ and/or discarding the source creature.' Sunburn reads, <br>
'Whenever a creature loses energy, it loses two additional energy.' <br>
<br>
RT - No. Energy use to pay for the cost of a power does not count as energy <br>
loss, removing energy, etc. Another example is Dryte Fiend’s Effect, <br>
"Condemn." Using "Condemn" on an opponent’s 3 energy Magma Hyren won’t cause <br>
it to die when it uses one of its Powers.<br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
9. Shivara reads, 'Whenever one of your creatures is discarded by an opposing <br>
spell, instead return that creature to its owner's hand.' Crushing spells <br>
read, 'Choose any one creature in play. Discard four from the chosen <br>
creature. If this discards the chosen creature from play...’ If a Crushing <br>
Spell is played on Shivara’s Creature… <br>
<br>
A. Is the creature returned to its owner's hand per Shivara's effect? Why or <br>
why not? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, the Creature would be returned to its owner’s hand, because it is <br>
being discarded from play by an opposing Spell. <br>
<br>
B. If it is, does the second effect of the crushing spell go off? <br>
<br>
RT - No, because Shivara’s Effect says that the Creature is returned to its <br>
owner’s hand "instead". The secondary effect of the Crushing Spell would not <br>
occur. <br>
<br>
C. If her effect goes off, does it go off for all energy removal spells? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, if the spell is an opposing one and reduces the Creature to zero <br>
energy. These questions were also partly covered in the previous Rules Digest <br>
(02/25/03) <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
10. My opponent wants to cast Crushing _______ on my Mosp so they can attack <br>
my other creatures. My Vogo uses Interrupt to retarget the spell to my <br>
Sandstone Hyren, which is currently the largest creature in play. Does my <br>
Sandstone Hyren simply take four damage or does my opponent find themselves <br>
paying the extra cost to target Sandstone Hyren? Does the spell just fizzle? <br>
What if my opponent can not afford the extra cost? <br>
<br>
RT - The Sandstone Hyren will lose four energy from the Crushing Spell. Your<br>
opponent does not need to pay any additional energy because they did not <br>
choose the Sandstone Hyren. If you read Vogo, you will see that you are the <br>
one choosing the Sandstone Hyren, not your opponent. "Interrupt" says, "…you <br>
may choose any one of your other Creatures in play…"). <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
11. Can Yaw restore a frozen creature with more than it's starting energy <br>
back down to their starting energy? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes. Restoring a Creature to its starting energy can add or remove <br>
energy. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
12. Does Icefang Battlesled allow creatures that normally could not attack <br>
strike a Magi? Unlike Energy Band it does not have the "if able" text. <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, Icefang Battlesled allows the chosen Creature to attack, even if it <br>
would normally not be allowed to. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
13. Thresh - Weave Dream Creature <br>
Power - Rethresh: Whenever a Weave card is discarded from play on an <br>
opponent's turn, add one energy to Thresh. <br>
The question is the Power - "Rethresh" supposed be an Effect? The reason this <br>
is important is how would this Power be triggered during an opponent’s turn <br>
and how would it work if the Thresh is frozen? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes. This is a misprint. Treat the card as if it said, "Effect – <br>
Rethresh: Whenever…" <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
14.First: From the newest rulebook the steps to use a Power. <br>
1. Announce that you are using the Power. <br>
2. Pay all costs associated with that Power such as energy loss and/or <br>
discarding the source Creature. These costs occur and are paid <br>
simultaneously. <br>
3. Check to see if any Creatures have reached zero energy. If they have, <br>
discard them from play. If the source Creature is discarded at this point, <br>
the Power still continues to operate. <br>
4. Make all choices involved. If there is no longer a valid card to choose, <br>
then the Power ceases. If a Power requires you to discard a Creature, choose<br>
it now. <br>
<subsequent steps omitted> <br>
<br>
Now Inferno Xyx: <br>
Power-Blast: (4) Discard Inferno Xyx from Play. Choose any one creature in <br>
play. Discard fifteen energy from the chosen creature. <br>
<br>
The situation was there was an Inferno Xyx in play with just 4 energy. Can it <br>
use the power? Because the step of paying the cost is 4e AND discard the <br>
creature, these payments occurs simultaneously. Now how does this differ from <br>
Xyx Minor from selecting itself for boosting? Is it the fact that step 3 <br>
occurs before 4 and thus the Xyx Minor cannot choose itself? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, an inferno Xyx at four energy can use its Power. The same is true <br>
for cards like Core Grag; if a Creature uses a Power with a self-referential <br>
discard cost (meaning it specifically names itself to be discarded), then the <br>
cost is filled if the Creature ends up in the discard pile at any point <br>
during cost payment. <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
15. This is just a question of the results of effects stacking. When a Comet <br>
Hyren attacks it deals double damage to the opposing creature. If I had a <br>
Storm Wings out, would it double the energy based on what the Comet Hyren's <br>
Bright Tail effect since this is what it removes "normally?" I doubt it, but <br>
it is something to know. <br>
<br>
RT - No; The two overlap (they do not stack) because both effects 'set' the <br>
energy removed based on the Creature's current energy total. A 7E Comet Hyren <br>
would remove fourteen energy (both its Effect and Storm Wings cause it to <br>
remove the same final amount of energy). <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
16. Instant Fortress and Laranel both cards state that if a creature a <br>
creature or Magi is choose. Any cards that don't specifically say "choose" <br>
can pass through Laranel and Fortress? Like Xyx, discard 4 energy from any <br>
Magi. Or any spell or power of mass removal (multiple targets). <br>
<br>
RT - The most recent printing of Xyx uses the word, "choose." Additionally, <br>
cards that have a global effect, like Ormagon, Poison Baloo Root, Cataclysm,<br>
etc. are not affected by Laranel (or Sandstone Hyren, or Instant Fortress, <br>
etc.). Card effects that do not "choose" are not affected by those cards. <br>
Note that there are a few cards that clearly involve choices, but do not <br>
specifically use the word Choose. Any time that you have to make a decision<br>
regarding which card to affect, you are "choosing," for all game purposes. <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
17. Horizon Mirage let you play creatures for free at the end of the next <br>
turn. If the turn in which the cards suppose to be play and a Spirit of Nar <br>
is played by my opponent. What happened to the creatures? Are wasted, or will <br>
have to wait another turn to be play? <br>
<br>
RT - Spirit of Nar prevents a player from playing cards from their hand. It <br>
has no effect on cards played from any other location. <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
18. If 2 Ballistic Baldars are play by the same player. Will both effect <br>
trigger at the same time or just 1? If one of the effect resolve first then <br>
the other Baldar may lose 3 energy and will not be able to do his effect, <br>
right? <br>
<br>
RT - Both Ballistic Baldars’ Effects will trigger. Ballistic Baldar’s Effect <br>
occurs whether or not it has enough energy. If the Effect removes the last of <br>
the Baldar’s energy, the Baldar is discarded and the Effect does nothing <br>
else. <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
19. Could I really make a Weave/Naroom creature attack FOUR times a turn <br>
using The Hunt, Weave Seed, and Yaki's Gauntlets? The Hunt allows Weave <br>
creatures to attack twice. Weave Seed allows an ADDITIONAL attack. Yaki's <br>
Gauntlets allows yet another ADDITIONAL attack. Bungaloos are a Weave/Naroom <br>
creature. Thus it is affected by both spells and the relic. Wence the <br>
Wanderer can cast both spells and play the relic without penalty or <br>
restriction. He can also play Gift of the Weave. <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, the Creature would be able to attack four times in the example <br>
given. <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
20. I want to be sure, but if I draw a card outside my draw step and my <br>
opponent puts down a snow barl pup, do I get to discard my phrup to get rid <br>
of it? And if I choose to do so, am I correct in assuming that my opponent <br>
does not get four free energy back since they did not spend any to summon if<br>
they are Nar magi? What about if Vertigo was cast? Does the penalty from <br>
Vertigo get paid when putting down the snow barl pup and then get put back on <br>
the magi? <br>
<br>
RT - This question is acutally several questions, and the answers can be <br>
broken down into a few rules. <br>
<br>
A. Yes, you can use Phrup to stop a Snow Barl Pup that is played using its <br>
Effect. You may use Phrup’s "Time Lapse" any time an opponent plays a card. <br>
<br>
B. If your opponent paid no energy to play the Time Lapsed card (for example, <br>
if they Dreamdraft a Snow Barl Pup using a Nar Magi), then no energy is <br>
returned to that Magi. If that player paid energy to play that card (for <br>
example, if they Dreamdraft a Snow Barl Pup using a non-Nar Magi), that much <br>
energy is returned to that player’s Magi; this includes all cost increases <br>
(like regional penalties) or reductions (like robes of the ages). <br>
<br>
C. Vertigo only affects a Magi on that Magi’s Player’s turn. It does not <br>
increase the cost of cards played by that Player on anyone else’s turn. <br>
<br>
D. Snow Barl Pup, when played using its effect "Dreamdraft" ignores all <br>
costs. If its cost would somehow be increased, it would ignore the increased <br>
cost. <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
21. Koll plays and activates Kybar's Fang. After using it to attack and crush <br>
a 6 energy Grax, Koll realizes that he only has two energy left and the Fang <br>
will revert back to a relic at the end of the turn, leaving him open and with <br>
only two energy. Can Koll use Dream Twist to twist out Kybar's Fang and bring <br>
in another creature to defend? If so, what can Koll twist in? Is Kybar's Fang <br>
considered to have a starting energy of eight? Fourteen? <br>
<br>
RT - None; a Creature that is not printed as a Creature has a printed <br>
starting energy of zero. <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
22. It was ruled previously that if a shadow deck with Nagsis used <br>
Interchange several times that the shadow magi would no longer be a shadow<br>
magi as they have "forgotten" being possessed after they came up a second <br>
time. By the same logic, could Bria play some non-Orothe/non Universal relics <br>
from one region, Interchange out, then play relics from a different region <br>
the next time she Interchanged in, and so on and so on? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes. Bria’s Effect is use each time she is revealed. <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
23. how do regional penalties work for universal magi? can they just summon <br>
what ever they want without peneltay? enlighten me please. <br>
<br>
RT - From the 10/23/02 Digest: <br>
<br>
"Universal Magi are from their own region, which is a jack-of-all-trades and <br>
yet a master of none. They must pay a regional penalty for all non-Universal <br>
cards while non-Universal Magi continue to have no penalty for Universal <br>
cards. <br>
<br>
The Universal 'region' is what the Eliwan wielded initially from the time <br>
they started using the magic of the Moonlands. It is the basis for which all <br>
magic of the Moonlands is founded; later on, different regional founders and <br>
elders tempered the practices and learnings of the Eliwan to tailor their own <br>
distinct styles of magic, encompassing the summoning of non-Universal Dream <br>
Creatures as well. While regional Magi had to learn the Eliwan teachings as a<br>
foundation for their more specialized, regional-specific forms of magic, <br>
Universal Magi never fully graduated beyond the initial Eliwan teachings, <br>
either by choice (Rayje), lack of access (Tuku), or lack of practice (Tony <br>
Jones)." <br>
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
24. does Targ'n's enhanced invulnerability work with sandstone hyrens super <br>
invulnerability? <br>
<br>
RT - No. Enhanced Invulnerability only works for Creatures with the Effect <br>
"Invulnerability". <br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
24. Chur has a Dark Cragnoc, a Vogo (thanks to Agram's Staff), and a Dagok in <br>
play. The opponent wants to hit the Dagok with a Grow spell. Chur uses the <br>
Vogo's Interupt to redirect the spell to the Dark Cragnoc. Does the DC gain <br>
energy from Grow? Or does the Vogo count for being the one making DC get the <br>
spell, thus counting as one of my cards and not having effect? <br>
<br>
RT - Dark Cragnoc cannot gain energy from your cards, but your opponent’s <br>
Grow is not your card (Vogo does not change the controller of the Spell or <br>
Power). The Dark Cragnoc would gain the energy.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Law posted an old version of the proposed errata. The correct<br>
errata on Will of Orothe is:<br>
<br>
Will of Orothe<br>
Orothe Spell<br>
6<br>
Attach Will of Orothe to an opposing Magi. While Will of Orothe is attached,<br>
that Magi's Creatures may not use Powers. During that Magi's Attack step,<br>
you choose whether or not that Magi's Creatures attack and what they attack.<br>
A Creature may not attack another Creature or Magi controlled by the same<br>
player. Discard Will of Orothe at the beginning of your next turn.<br>
<br>
    1. Double Freeze?<br>
2. Triple Strike?<br>
3. Attack Timing Revisited.<br>
4. Move with Tryn Flame-Saver<br>
5. Staffing Will of Orothe?<br>
6. Stalking<br>
7. Gilded Cage vs. Gloom<br>
8. Krawg: Too hot to be cool?<br>
9. Sandsifter: Man of Steel?<br>
10. Sand Strands<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
1. If you and your opponent have Nar Magi with an Essence of Frost in <br>
play and you want to play a spell of the Nar spell, would you have to <br>
pay two additional energy due to both Essence of Frost being in play?<br>
<br>
RT - No. 'Frozen' is a status effect, and as such is not culumative (it does <br>
not stack).<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
2. If I have both in play do my Naroom creatures get to attack 3 times <br>
each turn? I question that they can sice the name of both the power <br>
and effect are the same (Double Strike) and am unsure if both would <br>
apply.<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, Yaki and his Gauntlets work together. The name of a Power or Effect <br>
has no bearing on whether or not it works <br>
with another Power or Effect. <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
3a. The current rule on attacking-triggers is: Unless specified otherwise, <br>
things that trigger on an attack occur after<br>
that attack is complete (aftyer energy is removed). Is this correct? <br>
<br>
RT - No, "on an attack" is not a recognized timing word. "As a creature <br>
attacks" triggers before energy is removed, and <br>
"When/Whenever" trigger after energy is removed.<br>
<br>
3b. If this is the case, and i think it is, what about Creeping Chill. Does <br>
it<br>
also only add energy to the Creatures after energy is removed (assuming they<br>
survive)?<br>
<br>
RT - Creeping Chill has been errata'd to have "as" timing. It triggers before <br>
energy is removed.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
4a. I only add energy equal to the energy that I remove when I use a Move <br>
power or spell?<br>
<br>
RT - Correct.<br>
<br>
4b. So if I have Tryn Flame-Saver use Energy Substitution (Cald) and my <br>
Kelthet uses Consume on another Creature that I own, suppose a <br>
Braggle with 4e. My Braggle gain 4e, but my Kelthet gains 4e too?<br>
<br>
RT - No, the definition of Move is "discard X energy to add X energy." In <br>
this case, Energy Substitution turns the energy <br>
discard into an energy gain. This allows the Kelthet to add instead of <br>
discard energy from his target, but since there was <br>
no energy discarded from the target, there will be no energy added to the <br>
Kelthet.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
5a. Are you now able to staff the Will of Orothe? Is it considered to <br>
be 'affecting only the magi' or is it affecting the creatures as <br>
well? What if you don't have any creatures in play, would the Staff <br>
work then?<br>
<br>
RT - No. Will of Orothe affects both the Player (decisions about creature <br>
attacks) and his or her Creatures (may not use <br>
powers), but does not affect the Magi at all.<br>
<br>
5b. Just curious how this stops the Will/Entangle combo.<br>
<br>
RT - The major change is the fact that a new magi flip will not enter play <br>
under the effects of Will of Orothe. You now <br>
also have the ability to remove Will with a Sandstorm Orhsaa and Rayje's <br>
Cloak.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
6. The digest stated in regards to stalking, "Yes, if the conditions for <br>
Dodge are met, the Flutter Yup will lose no <br>
energy during that attack." <br>
My understanding of being stalked was that the damage dealt by it has nothing<br>
to do with the attack itself. I am to understand this ruling as a change to <br>
the<br>
way stalk is dealt with (is it to be considered more like a granas's pummel<br>
than a status condition)?<br>
<br>
RT - No, this is not a change, Stalking removes energy during the attack as <br>
it always has. You may be confusing this with a ruling about Stalking vs. <br>
Burrow. Flutter Yup affects energy loss "in the attack," meaning any energy <br>
loss that occurs to Flutter Yup during the attack from any source. Burrow <br>
affects energy loss "from attacks", which refers specifically to energy loss <br>
from attack resolution (step 7 of the Attack description in the glossary).<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
7. If Gilded Cage is discarded from hand to prevent the discard of a Creature<br>
from play by Gloom, is the second part of Gilded Cage triggered?<br>
Or does that not count because it's you that are discarding Gilded Cage from<br>
your hand rather than the opponent's card (Gloom)?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; you are discarding the Gilded Cage as a result of your opponent's <br>
Gloom spell, so you will get to draw cards from the Gilded Cage's <br>
anti-discard text. The fact that his Spell gives you a choice does not change <br>
the fact that an opposing spell caused the discard.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
8. Does the effect Immunity (opposing Effects do not affect Krawg) prevent <br>
Krawg from being frozen?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; if an opposing Effect is generating the Frozen status, Krawg will <br>
not be frozen by it. Of course, Krawg may still <br>
be frozen by your own Effects, or by opposing spells or Powers that freeze <br>
creatures.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
9. Does Sandsifter's unnamed Effect really have the ability to keep <br>
Sandsifter from dying in combat?<br>
<br>
RT - No; The reason it doesn't work is that you cannot retroactively add <br>
energy; so while something affected it to reduce <br>
it to zero energy, the Effect doesn't kick in until you've moved on to the <br>
next step of this process, which is "discard <br>
Sandsifter from play". Because the Effect can only negate how the opposing <br>
card is affecting the Sandsifter at present, all <br>
it can do is stop the Sandsifter from being discarded because the opposing <br>
card reduced it to zero energy (though the rules are forcing the discard as <br>
well, the source is still the card in question and is "affecting" the <br>
Sandsifter by changing its game state, i.e., changing it from being in play <br>
to not being in play). The Oracle is discarded, and the present discard <br>
effect (which has the rules as a catalyst but the opposing card as a source) <br>
is stopped, as per the text of the Effect.<br>
Now, we just end up with a generic situation of having a Creature in play <br>
with zero energy; similar to when a Creture spends all of its energy on a <br>
Power, the new cause of the discard is the rules, but it has no 'source' <br>
affecting it, it just <br>
happens.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
10. So, just to double check, will Sand Strands be clarified to match <br>
the current Illusion template?<br>
<br>
RT - No; The 'Illusionary' status granted by Sand Strands was intended to be <br>
different from normal Illusionary cards.<br>

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS <br>
<br>
Deep Wellisk <br>
Effect: Deep Wellisk may not be discarded from play by opposing cards while<br>
it has energy. Your cards cannot increase Deep Wellisk's energy total. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
1. Q. Will Ashio replace "Core Creature" for "Universal Creature" at <br>
the ForgottenDancer Universal Relic? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
2. Q. Drig's Leech Power affects all of an opponent's creatures. <br>
Would Sandstone Hyren's Monolith Effect activate? <br>
<br>
RT: No. Monolith isn't activated because Sandstone Hyren is not <br>
chosen. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
3. Q. Does Dewstone's Power work if it's played on the same turn that <br>
Creatures have been discarded? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes, it does. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
4. Q. Does Uwamar's Watch Effect activate on itself entering play? <br>
<br>
RT - No, for two reasons: One, Watch says "whenever you play <br>
any OTHER Weave creature". Two, Effects on creatures do not work <br>
until they are in play, unless they are self-referential (such as <br>
most Dreamwarp effects). <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
5. Q. so, when cards like bagala fangs say 'change a creature's <br>
starting energy to10, or 1, does that mean the energy actually on the <br>
card? or does it mean thenumber printed on the card? for instance, <br>
you have a bagala hunter in play, andit's taken a hit and is at 4 <br>
energy. you activate the bagala fangs and. . .what? does the hunter <br>
have 10 energy or 4 energy? depending on which is true,can you bring <br>
a creature's starting energy down to one and then use a yark oryark <br>
gloves on them? in other words, what energy changes, the printed <br>
energy,or the actually energy on the card? <br>
<br>
RT: The Powers on Bagala Fangs and Slime Stone only change <br>
the "effective" number on the card. They do not affect the actual <br>
amount of energy on the card, nor the literal printed value. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
6. Q. When Bagala Fangs or a Slime Stone is used to set a Quido <br>
Swarm's starting energy to 1, what happens next turn, when the Quido <br>
Swarm is restored to it's starting energy? Does "Calling" <br>
override "Downs" (or "Shriveled Dreams")? <br>
<br>
RT: "Downs" (or "Shriveled Dreams") sets Quido Swarm's starting <br>
energy to one, when the power is used. However "Calling", continually <br>
sets the Swarms energy to be equal to the number of Bograth and <br>
Paradwyn creatures in play. Calling has precedence. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
7. Q. This is a question about wording versus intent. Torpar gets an <br>
additionalenergy when all of your creatures gain energy. In our <br>
tournament this weekendit was brought to my attention that Torpar <br>
doesn't say "all at once." This isan extremely literal reading of the <br>
text, but would it still gain an additionalenergy if the energy gain <br>
occurs during the same turn, but at different times? <br>
<br>
RT: Torpar will only gain an additional energy if a card adds energy <br>
to every one of your creatures, all at once. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
8. Q. Also a question about Drakhar. Does its Dominate trigger when <br>
the Drahkar is undreamed or only when he leaves play and goes into <br>
the discard? <br>
<br>
RT: Cards are considered discarded if their immediate destination is <br>
the discard pile. Undream-ed cards go to the hand, not the discard. <br>
Drahkar's Dominate only triggers when it is discarded (either while <br>
it has energy, or by being reduced to zero energy). <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
9. Q. Well, Koll's Dream Twist doesn't says anything about Printed <br>
Starting energy. I have see someone who use Slime Stone on a <br>
creatures in order to get a 9 energy creature with it. <br>
Ex. A Vopok is played. It came with 10 energy. Slime Stone is used to <br>
set it to 10 Starting energy in order to play a Sandstone Hyren from <br>
the deck. <br>
<br>
My questions is: It's this legal? Since Dream Twist says to discard <br>
the creature first, then Vopok will me back to starting 4 since cards <br>
doesn't have memory when are discard, right <br>
<br>
RT: Your opponent is correct; while cards do lose their memory of such <br>
effects when they leave play, at the time the Power is used, the Vopok does <br>
have a starting energy of ten, because those values are checked and 'locked <br>
in' during activation; otherwise, effects that are dependent on the amount of <br>
energy a Creature has that must discard the Creature in order to use it would <br>
do nothing, as by the time the resolution began, the Creature would have no <br>
energy because of being removed from play. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
10. Q. If a Creature loses no energy in attacks (such as a Creature <br>
Shielded by Shard of the Great Fossil) does it still lose energy from <br>
Effects that would normally affect them (such as Crystal Lascinth's <br>
Spines or Rehlya's Counterweave)? <br>
<br>
RT: A Creature that loses no energy in attacks, will lose no energy <br>
from Rehlya's Counterweave, or Crystal Lascinth's Spines. This is <br>
different from loses no energy "from" attacks. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
11. Q. We need a ruling on Barqua's bubble, shell, and Cawh. Would a <br>
Barqua's Bubble be able to protect a Cawh from a spell such as <br>
Dessicate, or Sandswirl? (Since they discard energy) And since Cawh's <br>
effect changes a Shockwave's direct discard to energy loss, could a <br>
bubble or shell then protect the Cawh from them? <br>
<br>
RT: -Barqua's Bubble cannot protect Cawh from Dessicate. Cawh's first Effect<br>
states "...other cards cannot prevent Cawh <br>
from losing energy." <br>
-Sandswirl does not discard energy, it merely increases the energy <br>
discarded in attacks, so yes, Bubble could stop Sandswirl from <br>
affecting Cawh. <br>
-Barqua's Bubble can protect Cawh from Shockwave because you may <br>
choose to resolve the Bubble before Cawh's protective Effect. <br>
-If Cawh is losing the six energy to prevent a discard Effect, he is <br>
losing the energy from its own Effect, not from an opposing card. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
12. Q. Does the Sand Hyren affect itself the first time it is played <br>
with the Magi Drajan? <br>
<br>
RT: No; see Question 4. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
13. Q. Here is my question:In the most recent RD, it was stated that <br>
Will of Orothe cannot be staffed as it affects the player and the <br>
Magi. But, as per the errata attaching WoO toa Magi is the first <br>
step, does this not make it Staffable? <br>
<br>
RT: Once again, The correct Errata on Will of Orothe is: <br>
Will of Orothe <br>
Orothe Spell <br>
6 <br>
Attach Will of Orothe to an opposing Magi. While Will of Orothe is <br>
attached, that Magi's Creatures may not use Powers. During that <br>
Magi's Attack step, you choose whether or not that Magi's Creatures <br>
attack and what they attack. A Creature may not attack another <br>
Creature or Magi controlled by the same player. Discard Will of <br>
Orothe at the beginning of your next turn. <br>
<br>
Attaching a card to a Magi does not inherently affect the Magi. Will of <br>
Orothe does not affect the Magi, because it does not in any way alter the <br>
game state of the Magi; it instead affects the Magi's player, the Magi is <br>
needed so that the Will has a 'point of reference' to see which player it's <br>
supposed to affect, but it's never directly interacted with by the Spell. It <br>
also affects the Magi's Creatures, "That magi's creature's may not use <br>
powers." Will of Orothe is not 'staff-able'. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
14. Q. Just wondering how this works lets say I've got a creature <br>
with 1 energy and my magi has 1 energy also but my creature has a tar <br>
hyren on it (it's effect is that at the beginning of my turn before I <br>
energize my magi and my creature lose 1 energy each) do I get to go <br>
to my next magi this turn or not becuse my magi dies before I <br>
energize? or do I energize before it takes the energy? <br>
<br>
RT: At the beginning or your turn, your Creature and your Magi would <br>
lose one energy. Your Magi would be defeated. You would not get to <br>
flip your next Magi. All events (game rules, Magi flipping, or <br>
Effects) trigger at the same time. In this case at the beginning of <br>
your turn. Then the Active player processes their Effects and game <br>
events in the order they choose. In this case, the Active player has <br>
none. Then the inactive player processes their Effects in the order <br>
they choose. In this case the Effect on the attached Tar Hyren. Since <br>
you have already passed the point at which you can reveal new Magi, <br>
you do not get to. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
15. Q. Can the Fird Stone be use against the Will of Orothe? In the <br>
lastdigest you guys says that it affect the creatures. So can a Furok <br>
beprevent from attack next turn? or even more all creatures since <br>
thefird stone says that the spell do noting?Also Fird Stone says <br>
whenever, which is a bit odd with the "wheneverrule". Whenever is <br>
suppost to be after spell power etc. is resolved.So if the spell, <br>
power etc. is already resolve the what's the point onusing Fird Stone <br>
since it already happend?On the other hand if the Fird Stone were <br>
made with "as' word it mightbe too strong. <br>
<br>
RT: Yes, Fird Stone can protect all of your Furoks (not all of your <br>
Creatures) from Will of Orothe. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
16. Q. If shattershards discards a relic with an x in the cost, <br>
should itassume that x == 0?This came up in a recent game when I <br>
played shattershards on a Naroommagi with Evu's Jellybeans(the only <br>
relic with an x cost currently, Ibelieve) in play. My opponent had <br>
originally placed two counters onthe relic, but only had one left. If <br>
x =/= 0, then what would x havebeen considered at the time <br>
shattershards was played?(My guess is two,since x =/= jellybeans....) <br>
Oh, =/= is does not equal, btw. <br>
<br>
RT: In all cases where x is not specified, x = zero. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
17. Q. It has been brought to my attention that the Grass Etiki <br>
effect Dreamwarper does not stack if there are multiple copies of <br>
Grass Etiki in play. I've been looking through the previous Digests <br>
trying to find this, but I've been unable to. If you could direct to <br>
the right digest or explain why this doesn't stack and yet Ergars do <br>
I'd appreciate it. <br>
<br>
RT: Multiple Grass Etikis will add multiple Dreamwarps to your Weave <br>
Creatures and multiple copies of Weave to your Paradwyn Creatures. Three <br>
Grass Etikis in play will allow you to Dreamwarp for up to three Energy, <br>
and allow you to use the Weave Effect for up to a three Energy shift. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
18. Q. Giant Parmalag: <br>
Power-Withdraw: 3 Giant Parmalag cannot be attacked until after your <br>
next turn. <br>
Gum-Gum:Effect-Slide: When Gum-Gum is attacked, you may switch it <br>
with any other Creature you control before energy is removed. <br>
If there is a Gum-Gum and a Giant Parmalag in play on one side and <br>
the Giant Parmalag uses it Withdraw power, and an opponent attacks <br>
the Gum-Gum, what would happen if Gum-Gum tried to use it Slide <br>
Effect onto the Giant Parmalag? Would the attack be cancelled? Would <br>
the attack successfully hit the Giant Parmalag? Or would the Gum-Gum <br>
remain the target of the attack? <br>
<br>
RT: No Slide can happen. If a Creature cannot be attacked, then it cannot be <br>
designated as the defender during an attack; the Gum-Gum cannot Slide to a<br>
Withdrawn Giant Parmalag. This is an official reversal to previous rulings on <br>
the matter. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
19. Q. Kybar's Teeth and Underneath make for a strong combination, it <br>
has been said. That got me thinking about how some of their cards <br>
work together. Agrilla and Parmalag came to mind. If the Agrilla uses <br>
Fear on the Parmalag, that's a double strike with no energy loss, <br>
barring Rayje's Sword. Then I thought about Agrilla and one of <br>
Parmalag's best friends, Korrit. The Korrit can choose to Pack Hunt <br>
instead of attack. But what if the Agrilla let the Korrit have a <br>
second attack? Would that mean the Korrit would be allowed to Pack <br>
Hunt twice if it chose to? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes, if Korrit is chosen for Agrilla's fear, it can Pack Hunt <br>
twice. Korrit's Pack Hunt can be substituted for its normal attack, <br>
So if the Korrit can attack more than once, it can pack hunt more <br>
than once. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
20. Q. I start my turn with O'qua and I use Conjure. I then manage to <br>
interchange through all three Magi and I come back to O'Qua. Can I <br>
use Conjure again? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes, once a Magi leaves play, the rules for card memory forget whether he <br>
or she used <br>
a Power or not. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
21. Q. Let's say I have a Tree Hinko in play, and already used it's <br>
power. On my opponents turn he uses Crushing Fungus and happens to <br>
get rid of the Hinko. Then on my turn, I use a Flood of Energy, would <br>
I, in effect be canceling out the Hinko's power, energize for two <br>
more with the Flood, or just energize for two more the next time I <br>
energize? <br>
<br>
RT: After the Tree Hinko uses his power, the next time you energize, <br>
regardless of why, when, or how, you get the bonus. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
22. Q. It doesn't say discard one of your Oracles, so if my opponent <br>
tries to nuke my Sandsifter, I can really discard one of my <br>
opponent's Oracles to save it? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes, you may; 'any one Oracle' encompasses opposing Oracles as well.<br>
<br>
If so and this happens while my opponent is Risha, can she be <br>
instantly defeat this way? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes, if this scenario were to happen.<br>
<br>
Or (even worst) what happens if we both have 1 Sandsifter as our only <br>
Oracle? Wouldn't this targeting of the opponent's Oracle last <br>
forever, considering neither player would like to forfeit their <br>
Sandsifter? <br>
<br>
RT: Because an Oracle must be discarded to generate the effect of keeping the <br>
Sandsifter in play, discarding the Oracle is a 'cost'. Losing a card, energy, <br>
etc. for a cost has no source, and so the opposing Sandsifter would not get <br>
the opportunity to save itself by discarding an Oracle.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
23. Q. Kyg'n's effect "True Grit" states that he is not defeated, even <br>
if he has no creatures in play and no energy, until he is directly <br>
attacked. Does this protect him from "direct defeat" things like <br>
Awakening, Trug's Cataclysm and Risha's Glorious Prophesy? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes; he must still be attacked in order to be defeated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, if Kyg'n has a Dewstone in play, no energy, and an illusion in <br>
play, can he discard the Dewstone to gain five energy? (Or can any <br>
magi, for that matter?) <br>
<br>
RT: Yes, but only at the time in which he would be defeated. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
24. Q. Naroom Magi uses a power. Paradwyn Magi casts Bloom and uses <br>
K'teeb Thumper to Dream Thump. Is that legal or only possible if <br>
Naroom Magi used a power the previous turn, before Paradwyn Magi's <br>
turn? <br>
<br>
Scenario two: Naroom Magi uses power on a creature. Paradwyn Magi <br>
casts Bloom and has the K'teeb Thumper use it's power to Thump. <br>
Naroom magi then uses own K'teeb Thumper to Thump the Paradwyn K'teeb <br>
Thumper. Is that possible or not possible because the Paradwyn K'teeb <br>
Thumper used it' power with Bloom during Naroom Magi's turn? <br>
<br>
RT: No. Dreamthump specifies that the Creature or Magi must have <br>
used a Power on its last turn. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
25. Q. This question is about the card Furok Protector. The card says: <br>
<br>
Effect - Thick Coat <br>
When you play Furok Protector, choose an opposing Magi. Set Furok <br>
Protector's energy equal the chosen Magi's energize. <br>
<br>
Say Player A plays a Furok Protector. Player's B magi is Fiend of <br>
Furoks (energize rate 6). Furok Protector's energy is now 6. My <br>
question is does the three extra energy come from player's A magi, <br>
player's B magi, or neither? <br>
<br>
RT: Neither, you simply set the energy of the Creature equal to the <br>
opposing Magi's Energize rate. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
26. Q. If Scyalla uses Pet Project to make something like Drushes or <br>
Wudges Weave Creatures, does that mean that Core magi will not be <br>
able to play those creatures? Barring something like Ashio with <br>
Agram's Staff, that is. <br>
<br>
RT: No, Pet Project only affects the Creatures of the chosen type <br>
that you play. It does not affect the opposing cards at all. <br>
<br>
Similarly, If Scyalla uses Pet Project to make Grags Weave creatures, <br>
does that mean Underneath and Kybar's Teeth magi can not use <br>
Cleansing to make Core Grag (now Weave Grag?) a Kybar's Teeth or <br>
Underneath creature? What if a creature is Cleansed first and then <br>
Pet Projected? <br>
<br>
RT: No. Your cards do not actually change type until they are <br>
played. When you play them, they come into play as Weave. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
27. Q. Can an Arderial Shadow Magi trigger Grand Epik's effects? If <br>
not, is there any way i can make the magi trigger the effects? <br>
<br>
RT: No. All Shadow Magi are Core Magi. <br>
<br>
Do all shadow magi need agram's staff to play cards of their original <br>
region? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes, unless a card states otherwise. There are several cards <br>
that include text such as "[region] shadow magi may play [this <br>
card]," and some magi such as Evil Evu have specific text allowing <br>
them to play non-core cards. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
28. Q. If I play an Abraxin's Crown from my hand to block a Storm of <br>
Fishes, do I still need to show my hand to my opponent? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes. Storm of Fishes does two things. It Reveals your hand then <br>
discards cards; Abraxin's Crown only stops the discard. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
29. Q. Wence the Wanderer plays Tuk Berries and Energy Band in his <br>
first Spells/Powers/Relics phase. He uses both of their powers on his <br>
Bungaloo. Which one takes priority? Or does it depend on the order in <br>
which he used the relics' powers? <br>
<br>
RT: The Creature may not attack. Charge says it must attack if <br>
able, but Nourish says that it may not attack. <br>
<br>
Does the first power used take priority or the second power used? <br>
Does it make a difference if the creature is a Junjertrug? <br>
<br>
RT: No; since Hunger says if able, Nourish takes precedent. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
30. Q. Does the errata on Deep Wellisk eliminate energy <br>
reorganization through cards such as Flame Control? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes; the text of the Wellisk's nameless Effect should be read as follows: <br>
<br>
Effect: Deep Wellisk may not be discarded from play by opposing cards while<br>
it has energy. Your cards cannot increase Deep Wellisk's energy total. <br>
<br>
If a rearrange effect is used, energy may be taken from the Wellisk, but if <br>
you try to place it back (or place it there from another source), the energy <br>
is lost. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
31. Q. If my Rock Hyren is hit with a Sawgrass, is it discarded from <br>
play? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes. <br>

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS<br>
<br>
None at this time.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
1. From previous digest: [6. Ninx has Rayje's cloak in play with no energy. <br>
Ninx stare down the opposing magi. <br>
The opposing player drops a climbing staff. <br>
Who would win out in this situation. <br>
<br>
RT - The Climbing Staff. The Climbing Staff does not prevent the use of the <br>
Power, it lets the Power happen, it just makes it 'do nothing'.] <br>
<br>
<br>
And also, that Climbing Staff stops Sorreah's effect permanently. I would <br>
like to know if the same works for Powers since Climbing Staff does not <br>
spefify a duration... using the example above, would Ninx be able to use <br>
Stare Down again, during his other turn? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, she would be able to; what the Climbing Staff does is make the <br>
instance of whatever effect it negates do nothing. This applies to the single <br>
instance of the Power, Spell, etc; the difference with a continuous Effect <br>
such as Suppress is that once it becomes active, it continues until it leaves <br>
play, and since nothing can "switch it off", it will always be able to do <br>
nothing. The only thing that can 'turn off' a continuous Effect is for a card <br>
to not be able to use it; then, if it becomes legally usable afterward, it <br>
becomes a new instance of the Effect (just like using a Power in successive <br>
turns are new instances of the Power) and would have to be undone with <br>
another Climbing Staff or similar measure. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
2. If you were to use Mohani or Thrybe to make sandswirl a power on one <br>
of your creatures, what would happen when the creature then tried to <br>
use said power? <br>
<br>
RT - As with any other Spell that must attach itself, the Spell card would be <br>
moved to the chosen Creature or Magi, and the Power could no longer be used <br>
as there is no Spell card attached to reference. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
3. Lets say an opponent uses Cataclysm to discard all of Ninx's <br>
creatures/relics. She uses Bloom in response, spending her LAST point <br>
of energy... would she be defeated before she could stare-down? <br>
<br>
RT - No; the rules of Magi defeat for having no energy in play require all <br>
pending Spells and other effects to resolve before the Magi is discarded from <br>
play. Bloom doesn't resolve until the Power it allows you to use resolves, so <br>
Ninx would get her Stare Down before being defeated. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
4. From previous digest: [23. Q. Kyg'n's effect "True Grit" states that he is <br>
not defeated, even <br>
if he has no creatures in play and no energy, until he is directly <br>
attacked. Does this protect him from "direct defeat" things like <br>
Awakening, Trug's Cataclysm and Risha's Glorious Prophesy? <br>
<br>
RT: Yes; he must still be attacked in order to be defeated. <br>
<br>
Question: Why does Kyg'ns effect "True Grit" set precedence over Risha's <br>
"Glorious Prophecy"?] <br>
<br>
RT - Glorious Prophecy defeats an opposing magi. However, Kyg'n's effect <br>
states that he "is not defeated", even if he normally would be, until he is <br>
directly attacked while in a state that would normally indicate his defeat. <br>
Whereas direct defeat affects circumvent the defeat rules by ignoring them <br>
and removing the Magi anyway, True Grit takes it one step higher and adds an <br>
additional requirement to defeat, no matter how it may occur. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
5. One of the local player ask me to get something in writing to <br>
clarify Olum Digger's Power. Say you play Olum Digger in you play <br>
creature step and during your second p/s/r/ step you pay the 1e to <br>
atack a magi directly this turn. He believes that you would be able <br>
to attack your opponents Magi directly during the second p/s/r step. <br>
I ruled you would not be able to because you can not fulfill the <br>
obligation of an attak since you are past you attack step. <br>
<br>
RT - The Power does not allow the chosen Creature to attack outside of the <br>
Attack step; the Creature would not be able to attack. <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
6. if I have 2 ergars in play can I use 2 sparks at same time? <br>
<br>
RT - RT - No; two ergars do grant two copies of Spark, but Powers cannot be <br>
voluntarily activated simultaneously. You may choose to use and resolve the <br>
first copy of Spark, then choose and resolve the second copy of Spark.<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
------------------------ <br>
7. Here's a situation that a player posed at our last tournament. <br>
<br>
Hypothesis: Under previous rulings, the function of Move is discard <br>
then add. Tryn Flame-Saver can use Energy Substitution to alter a <br>
Move function. <br>
<br>
Example: There are two creatures under your control. One shall remain <br>
nameless and the other is a Giant Arboll. Now let's break down the <br>
Giant Arboll's Power of Healing Flame. In essence due to the function <br>
of Move it says... <br>
<br>
"Choose any one Creature or Magi in play. Discard up to six energy <br>
from Giant Arboll then Add the same amount of energy to the chosen <br>
Creature or Magi." <br>
<br>
Now let's see what happens when your Magi is Tryn Flame-Saver. Before <br>
we begin it is worth noting you have yet to deal any damage to one of <br>
your own creatures this turn. Tryn Flame-Saver uses Energy <br>
Substitution and then activates Healing Flame on the Giant Arboll. By <br>
the Hypothesis, Giant Arboll's Healing Flame functionally changes <br>
to... <br>
<br>
"Choose any one Creature or Magi in play. Add up to six energy to <br>
Giant Arboll then Add the same amount of energy to the chosen <br>
Creature or Magi." <br>
<br>
End Example <br>
<br>
In this example, because the discard function of Move is exactly one <br>
Cald Power, could this mean the Giant Arboll can first add up to six <br>
energy (if it already has six energy) to itself, then choose itself <br>
as the recipient of six more energy? <br>
<br>
RT - No; the caveat to the move mechanic is that it will not add energy if <br>
none was literally discarded, because move mechanics are not "discard THEN <br>
add", they are "discard TO add". Though the energy amount that Energy <br>
Substitution changed from discard to add was intended as discard, it did not <br>
literally discard, so that amount is not added during the "add X energy" part <br>
of the move mechanic, where 'X' is the amount actually discarded. <br>

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
None at this time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
1a. Can Sunburn be attached to Lovian (is attaching the card considered to <br>
<br>
be affecting Lovian)? If Sunburn can be attached to Lovian, when a <br>
<br>
damage condition occurs to Lovian to trigger the Sunburn, can Sunburn <br>
<br>
damage Lovian?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1b. Is attaching a non-Arderial Spell (such as Sunburn) to a Lovian legal? <br>
<br>
In this case, I assume the Lovian wouldn't receive extra damage from <br>
<br>
the Sunburn. What if Haunt is attached to a Lovian? Is the Lovian's <BR> <br>
Resistance still active when it is discarded? At what point does the <br>
<br>
Resistance shut off?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – Attaching a card to something does not necessarily affect it. You <br>
<br>
can attach Sunburn (and other non-Arderial Spells) to a Lovian. <br>
<br>
Sunburn does not affect the Creature it is attached to, it only <br>
<br>
changes the amount of energy removed by other cards. It will work <br>
<br>
normally while attached to a Lovian. In the case of Haunt, the Lovian <br>
<br>
will be returned to play on the Haunt’s controller’s side because <br>
<br>
Resistance only applies when the Lovian is in play. <br>
<br>
However, the Lovian will not become Core and can attack on the same <br>
<br>
turn it returns to play. This is because the changing of region and <br>
<br>
the cannot-attack-this-turn parts of Haunt occur while the Lovian is <br>
<br>
in play – Resistance applies.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
2. Does a creature has to be in play at the time I discard Magma Parmalag <br>
<br>
for that creature to benefit from the Parmalag's power?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – No. Magma Parmalag’s Power affects Creatures that come into play <br>
<br>
after it has been used. Unless you are required to choose a Creature <br>
<br>
in play (Agram’s Armor), or the card has been clarified to state <br>
<br>
otherwise (like Shadow Cloak), cards that affect your Creatures for a <br>
<br>
stated duration will apply to those that come into play after it has <br>
<br>
been used until the specified duration has elapsed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
3. If your opponent has taken/stolen one of your Creatures, is that <br>
<br>
Creature still considered a Creature you have in play? If so, can you <br>
<br>
return it to your hand as part of the requirement to play <br>
<br>
Morag's 'Gift'?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – No. Whenever a card says ‘you’ or ‘your’ it is referring to the <br>
<br>
controller of the card it is printed on. If a card says to return one <br>
<br>
of ‘your’ Creatures to its owner’s hand, you can only return Creatures <br>
<br>
you control.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
4. Your opponent has a Venger in play and has played a sunburn on one of <br>
<br>
your Creatures with 5 energy on it currently. You have an Agram's <br>
<br>
Armor in play. At the beginning of you turn you choose to use the <br>
<br>
Agram's Armor effect on your creature with the sunburn attached to it. <br>
<br>
Moving on to your Attack phase, you then attack your opponent's <br>
<br>
Venger. What is the proper resolution of this situation?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – For this example, we’ll assume that your opponent’s Venger is at <br>
<br>
2 energy and that you are attacking it with your 5-energy Creature <br>
<br>
(with Sunburn attached). Your 5-energy Creature will remove 5 energy <br>
<br>
from the opponent’s Venger, defeating it. Your opponent’s Venger will <br>
<br>
remove 2 energy from your 5-energy Creature; 2 + 2 (Sunburn) – 2 <br>
<br>
(Shield) = 2. Your Creature will be left at 3 energy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
5. After your attack step you still have a minimum of 15 on your current <br>
<br>
Magi. You play a Gorath. You then proceed to take control of a <br>
<br>
player's creature using the Gorath's power. Once you've obtained your <br>
<br>
opponent's creature, you play a Shadow Rain on the stolen Creature. <br>
<br>
This leaves your Magi with zero energy, and two creatures in play. On <br>
<br>
your opponent's turn, they quickly finish off your Gorath, thus <br>
<br>
gaining control of their creature again and defeating your Magi. The <br>
<br>
question at hand is will your opponent's Creature that had the Shadow <br>
<br>
Rain played on it leave play at the end of your opponent's next Attack <br>
<br>
phase? If not, will it leave play at the end of your next Attack phase?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – Shadow Rain does not require that your Magi remain the same or <br>
<br>
that you retain control of the Creature in order to work. At the end <br>
<br>
of your next attack step Shadow Rain will move energy from that <br>
<br>
Creature to your Magi as normal. Due to the errata to Shadow Rain, <br>
<br>
this may or may not discard the Creature from play.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
6. My Abaquist takes over my opponents Twee; I now control the opponents <br>
<br>
Twee. My opponent defeats the Twee I control. The Twee is discarded <br>
<br>
from play and his effect is triggered. I explained that I am the <br>
<br>
target of the Twee's effect, Even though the Twee hits my opponents <br>
<br>
discard pile. Now here's the double Jeopardy. A friend to my opponent <br>
<br>
said that the Twee first hits my discard pile, giving me the benefit <br>
<br>
of his Effect. And then goes to my opponents discard pile also giving <br>
<br>
him the benefit. I tried to explain that "only cards you own can ever <br>
<br>
go to your discard pile" thus preventing the twice triggered effect. I <br>
<br>
know there are a few more cards with discarded-from-play triggered <br>
<br>
effects. I would appreciate some official weight to my argument. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – Twee’s Effect will only work once, and only for the player who <br>
<br>
controlled the Creature when it was discarded from play. When the card <br>
<br>
is placed in a discard pile, it will be sent to its controller's discard <br>
pile, but its final destination will be the owner's.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
7. Does Woot!'s effect "Savagery" override Invulnerability? We ruled it <br>
<br>
did, but we wanted to be sure.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – Yes, Woot!’s Wasperines remove energy as normal in attacks, <br>
<br>
regardless of Effects like Invulnerability (or status effects like <br>
<br>
Burrow).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
8. Ok, I saw the recent clarification of the "Move" effect, however, <br>
<br>
there were still a lot of questions about this locally. The local <br>
<br>
consensus was that "move" is a distinct effect, and, although it <br>
<br>
involves a removal of energy from one creature, and an addition to <br>
<br>
another, is not a "discard" or an "add". It was explained that this <br>
<br>
was (in part) to prevent problems with cards like "Flame Control" and <br>
<br>
a Magi like "Nara", who doubles energy "added". However, the <br>
<br>
conclusion drawn from this is that "move" effects circumvent most <br>
<br>
damage prevention/reduction, such as that of a Pylofuf or the Baby <br>
<br>
Furok, since the "move" isn't the same mechanism as a "discard" <br>
<br>
or "loss", as well as cards that are normally restricted from gaining <br>
<br>
energy (i.e. the Deep Wellisk), since the "move" is distinct from <br>
<br>
an "addition". Is this understanding correct, based on the most recent <br>
<br>
clarification?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
8b. Amanax’s ability says "Once per turn, when a Cald spell or power <br>
<br>
discards energy from one or more opposing Creatures, you may add one <br>
<br>
energy to Amanax for each energy removed." My question is does this <br>
<br>
work with Syphon Vortex (his starting card)? It says move not discard.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – Move means “Discard energy from one card to add as much energy as <br>
<br>
was discarded to another card.” This counts as both energy <br>
<br>
loss/discard and energy gain/addition. It will interact normally with <br>
<br>
cards that trigger on either adding or removing energy (like Forest <br>
<br>
Hyren’s ‘Underbrush’ or Amanax’s ‘Pyromaniac’) or those that prevent <br>
<br>
either adding or removing energy (like Tryn, Flame-Saver’s unnamed <br>
<br>
Effect or Pylofuf’s ‘Burrow’). ‘Rearrange’ is different from ‘move’ –<br>
<br>
‘Rearrange’ is not considered energy removal/discard or energy <br>
<br>
gain/addition. The ‘rearrange’ mechanic is only found on two cards: <br>
<br>
Flame Control and Gift of the Weave.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
9. Since cards that are regionally changed, by things like Scyalla and <br>
<br>
whatnot, pretty much aren't changed until they are actually played - <br>
<br>
how does Entomb fit into this? Scyalla actually references playing <br>
the card within her power, but Entomb just says that the card is Core <br>
now, effectively. The reason I ask, is because of the spell <br>
Cleansing. If Entomb doesn't change the card that is chosen until it <br>
is played, Cleansing would not be able to be used to return the <br>
Entombed spell to the light side, correct? Along the same lines, if <br>
Entomb doesn't change the Spell until it is played, does this mean <br>
that Entomb cannot be used to deny a non-Core opponent their good <br>
Spells, as their Magi would still be able to play the chosen Spell <br>
because it is not Core until it is cast? Sorry if this has already <br>
<br>
been addressed, but I was pretty sure that Cleansing was only <br>
<br>
discussed in relevance to cards like Scyalla.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – Entomb and Cleansing change the printed region of the named card. <br>
<br>
This change applies immediately (not just when the named cards are <br>
<br>
played), and applies to copies of the named cards in any hand, deck, <br>
<br>
discard pile, or cards in play. Scyalla’s Power specifically says that <br>
<br>
it applies to Creatures you play, and does not work the same way.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
10. My opponent has a Sandsifter in play - and a large pile of other <br>
<br>
Oracles. I use my Rockslide Hyren's Power "Crush." Crush states that <br>
it is not affected by opposing cards when it is used, and the amount <br>
of energy removed cannot be altered by opposing cards. Sandsifter's <br>
nameless Effect states that you may discard an Oracle whenever an <br>
opposing card affects Sandsifter to negate the effects of that <br>
opposing card. How does this resolve if the Sandsifter is chosen as a <br>
target of Crush? The new "as" timing seems to say that the <br>
<br>
Sandshifters Effect resolves once he is chosen, but before any part of <br>
<br>
the power takes effect - while once the Sanshifter is chosen, it seems <br>
<br>
that the Crush wording would prohibit Sandsifter's Effect from even <br>
<br>
triggering. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – Rockslide Hyren’s Power will operate normally until after <br>
<br>
energy has been removed. If this loss of energy would discard <br>
<br>
Sandsifter from play, you can then use its Effect to save it by <br>
<br>
discarding another Oracle from play. If you do, Sandsifter will not be <br>
<br>
discarded from play by Rockslide Hyren’s Power – however, it will <br>
<br>
still be at zero energy and will be immediately discarded from play by <br>
<br>
the game rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
11. The limited core card, Dark Twins is a double Magi. On the card it <br>
<br>
shows a picture of Hrada and Warrada, but the card only says it is an <br>
<br>
alternate Hrada. I was just wondering if it counts as both Hrada and <br>
<br>
Warrada.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – No. You can play The Dark Twins in the same Magi Stack as <br>
<br>
Warrada. In addition, Tomes of the Great Library and Warrada’s Ring <br>
<br>
are not starting cards for The Dark Twins.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
12. Plouk's power ‘Ringtesting’ lets him put out a creature before the <br>
<br>
attack step. I was using this power in my Bograth deck to put out <br>
<br>
things like Anjer, Bolobob, Moob, and Moss Quido. But this issue came <br>
<br>
up during a game I had: If Phlouk ‘Ringtests’ out a creature before <br>
<br>
the attack step and then immedideately uses that creature's power <br>
<br>
which causes it to discard itself, does Phlouk still have to pay the <br>
<br>
cost for the creature at the end of the turn? I assumed that I did <br>
<br>
not, but my Cald-playing opponent said that maybe I did.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – You only discard energy from Phlouk at the end of the turn if <br>
<br>
there is an energy value to check. If the Creature is no longer in <br>
<br>
play, you discard no energy from Phlouk. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
13. This came up in a tournament this past weekend and I ruled that you <br>
<br>
could not use Shell Game with Cawh because you could not fulfill the <br>
<br>
obligation of Shell Game since you opponent could not take control of <br>
<br>
Cawh. The other theory was that since you are using Shell Game that <br>
<br>
you are giving up control of Cawh (temporarily) and the trade would <br>
<br>
happen. The player with Cawh was starting that he would get control of <br>
<br>
his opponent’s creature (temporarily) and still retains control of <br>
<br>
Cawh. What I need to know is what, if any, of the 3 possibilities I <br>
<br>
have stated are correct or is the correct answer something different?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – Cawh only prevents opposing cards from taking control of Cawh. <br>
<br>
Nothing prevents you from giving an opponent control of Cawh. If you <br>
<br>
control both Cawh and Shell Game, you will exchange control of <br>
<br>
Creatures normally – however, when control would switch the Creatures <br>
<br>
back, Cawh will remain where it is (since Shell Game is now on an <br>
<br>
opposing card); the other Creature will return to its previous <br>
<br>
controller normally.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
14. My opponent has a Barqua's Bubble, a Vault of Knowledge Key, and <br>
<br>
another Relic in play. I use a Spell to remove energy from one of his <br>
<br>
creatures. When he activates the Bubble, since he has the Vault in <br>
<br>
play, can he choose then to discard the other Relic instead of <br>
<br>
shuffling the Bubble into his deck? Since Bubble says 'shuffle' <br>
<br>
instead of discard, I ruled that he must shuffle it in, and keep the <br>
<br>
other Relic in play. We were only playing casually, not a tourney, so <br>
<br>
I would like to have an official ruling for future tourneys.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – Correct; the Bubble must be shuffled back, and the Vault cannot prevent<br>
this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
15. Kyg'n has no creatures and 10 energy. Kyg'n gets attacked by a 15-<br>
<br>
energy creature. A friend argued that he was directly attacked, and <br>
<br>
had no energy, fullfilling all conditions to defeat him. I said that <br>
<br>
Kyg'n effect gets triggered after all conditions are met, which is <br>
<br>
after the attack, which means he must be attacked once more. Who's <br>
<br>
right?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – You are correct. An attack which removes the last of Kyg’n’s <br>
<br>
energy does not defeat him. In order to be defeated, Kyg’n must be <br>
<br>
attacked while in a state which would normally defeat him (like having <br>
<br>
no energy and no Creatures).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
16. Can the RT please explain exactly how to use dreamwarp? Does the magi <br>
<br>
pay the full cost of the creature plus an additional x (whatever the <br>
<br>
creature is dreamwarping for)? What happens at the end of turn?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – A Creature with a printed starting energy of 5 that has Dreamwarp <br>
<br>
can be played for 4, 5, or 6 energy. If you pay 6, it will come into <br>
<br>
play with 6 energy. Until the end of the turn, any cards that check <br>
<br>
that Creature’s starting energy value (Dream Balm, Ookami’s Drums, <br>
<br>
etc.) will treat that Creature as if its starting energy were 6 <br>
<br>
instead of 5. At the end of the turn, the Creature’s starting energy <br>
<br>
value reverts back to 5 (its printed starting energy value). This does <br>
<br>
not add or remove energy from the Creature.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
17. Can I discard Risha from play to save my Sandsifter from being <br>
<br>
discarded by an opposing card? Would this defeat Risha?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – Yes to both questions. Discarding a Magi from play defeats that <br>
<br>
Magi. In the above example, you could prevent your Sandsifter from <br>
<br>
being discarded by an opposing card by defeating your Magi, Risha – <br>
<br>
however, when your Magi is defeated, all of its cards are discarded <br>
<br>
from play (including the Sandsifter) by the Magi Defeat Rule.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
18. This question was brought up during a tournament. When using M'ck as <br>
<br>
your Magi, are you able to reduce the cost of Sandstone Hyren because <br>
<br>
it has ‘stone’ in it or does Stone/Stones have to be a single word as <br>
<br>
in ‘Crushing Stones’?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – M’ck’s Effects state that the cards must have the “word” in their <br>
<br>
name, not just the letters. It will not apply to cards like Sandstone <br>
<br>
Hyren.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
19. If my magi has 6 cards in his/her starting can I search for all of <br>
<br>
them in my first turn?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – No, you can search for up to five starting cards when revealing a <br>
<br>
new Magi. If your Magi has more than five starting cards (like Strag), <br>
<br>
you may only search for five of them. (Pg. 27, VotS Rulebook.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
20. If my opponent used 2 vortex of knowledge in his/her first turn (I <br>
<br>
drew 4 cards) and now is my first turn. Can I search for my 4 starting <br>
<br>
cards?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RT – Yes. When you reveal a new Magi, you may search for any of your <br>
<br>
Magi’s starting cards (up to 5), regardless of how many cards you have <br>
<br>
in your hand.<br>

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS<br>
<br>
Lesser Darbok<br>
Effect - Defend: When you play Lesser Darbok, choose one of your other <br>
Creatures in play. While Lesser Darbok has energy, the chosen Creature cannot <br>
be attacked.<br>
Effect - Tangle: If Lesser Darbok is defeated while defending, attach Lesser <br>
Darbok to the attacking Creature. While Lesser Darbok is attached, other <br>
cards cannot affect it and it cannot be discarded from play for having zero <br>
energy. The Creature it is attached to cannot attack.<br>
<br>
GENERAL GAMEPLAY RULING<br>
<br>
A Magi is defeated when they have no energy in play.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
1. When an opposing Magi has no energy and no creatures on their side <br>
of the board, what happens to creatures of his that I took control <br>
of? Do they get discarded when the magi who summoned them is <br>
defeated? How about creatures played with Severos? Or, on a similar <br>
line, relics stolen with Crushing Surf? <br>
<br>
RT - When a Magi is defeated, all cards under their control are also <br>
discarded from play. This does not affect cards that the defeated <br>
player owns which may still be in play under the control of an <br>
opposing player. The manner in which the opponent gained control of <br>
the card is irrelevant. <br>
----- <br>
2. Suppose I use Ninx to Stare Down the opposing Magi and the <br>
opponent discards Climbing Staff to make the Stare Down do nothing; I <br>
then play a Climbing Staff targeting the Climbing Staff of my <br>
opponent (if that is possible), since it is affecting my Mage. <br>
<br>
RT - You cannot use a Climbing Staff to stop a Climbing Staff. <br>
<br>
Cards like Climbing Staff and Bloom may have the potention of <br>
creating "batch" of effects like this, even longer. How they are <br>
handled? <br>
<br>
RT - The active player, the player whose turn it is, resolves his <br>
effects and actions first. <br>
<br>
Also, I would like to know if it is possible to take control of a <br>
creature with the Effect: Resistance with Spirit of the Core, since <br>
you play the Spirit when your Magi is defeat and only pick the <br>
creature later, when the Spirit is long gone. <br>
<br>
RT - Spirit of the Core is a Core Spell, and as such may not affect a <br>
Creature with Resistance. <br>
----- <br>
3. Player A had a Jip on the table. Player B had a Mirago on the <br>
table. Player B played a Gwaeg and discarded Olabra's Staff to <br>
Mirago's effect, adding an additional 2 energy to Gwaeg. Was the Jip <br>
able to gain energy from this? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes. The Gwaeg is gaining two energy. <br>
<br>
Would the same apply to Robe of Vines/Staff of Hyren/etc.? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes. <br>
<br>
Or is it like Dreamwarp but without paying extra energy off your magi? <br>
<br>
RT - No, Dreamwarp actually changes the starting energy, so the cost <br>
is different. <br>
----- <br>
4. When does Kyg'n's nameless Effect trigger, and how long does it <br>
last? In Nightmare's Dawn, players could just assume that it was <br>
whenever Kyg'n energized, but now we have this lovely little Nar <br>
spell called Exposure... <br>
<br>
RT - It is always in effect and checking. As such, if you have one <br>
Creature in play and play an Exposure, K'ygn would lose four energy. <br>
----- <br>
5. Orpus states that if ONE of your relics is targeted, you can <br>
discard energy from the Orpus to protect that relic. What happens <br>
when you opponent uses a card such as Beam of Light or Vaporize? Can <br>
the Orpus protect all targeted relics? <br>
<br>
RT - If the Beam of Light is discarding two of your Relics, the Orpus <br>
may discard one energy to save the first and another energy to save <br>
the second. Against Vaporize, the Orpus can choose to protect as <br>
many as it has energy for. <br>
----- <br>
6. Does Stradus' backlash stack with creatures' backlash? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes it does. The are no rules that state Powers or Effects may <br>
not stack if they have the same name. <br>
----- <br>
7. EFFECT - Reconstruct: Once per turn, you can play a Furok from <br>
your discard pile as if it were in your hand, paying all costs. <br>
<br>
One player (the one playing Core) interprets the EFFECT more as if it <br>
is a POWER, only using it when they are the active player and only <br>
when they are in the "Bring creatures into play phase". <br>
<br>
Another player disagrees, saying it is an EFFECT and can be triggered <br>
on either player's turn (either as an attacker on the Core player's <br>
turn, or as a blocker on the opponent's turn). <br>
<br>
Is either of these the correct interpretation, and if not - what is <br>
the correct interpretation. If not correct, should the effect be <br>
changed to <br>
a power? Should the effect only trigger on the active player's turn? <br>
<br>
RT - Because Reconstruct states "as if it were in your hand," you may <br>
play a Furok using the Effect any time that you are allowed to play <br>
creatures. Without another card effect, Reconstruct is only relevant <br>
during your Play Creaures step, as this is the only time you may <br>
normally play creatures. <br>
----- <br>
8. Lesser Darbok, d'Resh Dream Creature <br>
<br>
Effect - Defend: When you play Lesser Darbok, choose one of your <br>
other creatures in play. The chosen creature cannot be attacked <br>
while lesser darbok is in play. <br>
<br>
Effect - Tangle: If Lesser Darbok is defeated while defending, attach <br>
Lesser Darbok to the attacking Creature. While Lesser Darbok is <br>
attached, that Creature cannot attack. <br>
<br>
Ok, here's the situation and the problems. <br>
<br>
With my final two energy I play a Lesser Darbok, with defend I choose <br>
my Sikra an illusionary creature. The following turn a wasperine is <br>
played and attacks my Lesser Darbok which defeats it. This now triggers <br>
tangle, which now my lesser darbok is now on the wasperine. <br>
<br>
Now here's the problems. <br>
<br>
1.) Check to see if the creature is defeated, well the lesser darbok <br>
still has no energy on it. So it's defeated again. (Wait a second if <br>
this is the case Tangle does nothing and 2i wasted ink.) <br>
<br>
RT - Lesser Darbok's Effects should read as follows: <br>
<br>
Effect - Defend: When you play Lesser Darbok, choose one of your other <br>
Creatures in play. While Lesser Darbok has energy, the chosen Creature cannot <br>
be attacked. <br>
Effect - Tangle: If Lesser Darbok is defeated while defending, attach Lesser <br>
Darbok to the attacking Creature. While Lesser Darbok is attached, other <br>
cards cannot affect it and it cannot be discarded from play for having zero <br>
energy. The Creature it is attached to cannot attack. <br>
<br>
2.) Check to see if my Magi is defeated. (Well a creature can't <br>
normally be in play with zero energy but my Lesser Darbok is in play <br>
and I have an illusionary creature in play (the Sikra)) Guess my Magi <br>
is still alive, because I have a non-illusionary creature in play. <br>
<br>
RT - The rules for Magi defeat are stated in a slightly misleading manner in <br>
the rulebook; Magi are defeated specifically when they have no energy in play<br>
(as Illusionary Creatures do not count for purposes of Magi defeat, they are <br>
treated as having 0E), not generally when they have no Creature cards in play<br>
and no energy themselves. <br>
<br>
3.) Attacking the Lesser Darbok (which I'm assuming you can do <br>
because it's still in play) defeats the Lesser Darbok again, <br>
transferring his Tangle to the new creature. So basically you can't <br>
attack it again to get rid of it. Can you use a spell such as <br>
Brushfire or Shockwave? I know a Beam of Light works after all it is <br>
a creature with less then two energy <br>
<br>
RT - The Darbok cannot be affected; it may still be attacked and trigger any <br>
Effects dependent on attacks, but otherwise nothing will happen. <br>
<br>
4.) Lets Assume that my magi is not defeated by any of the above <br>
results. The lesser darbok is still in play because of Tangle...so <br>
can the Sikra be attacked? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, because the Lesser Darbok no longer has energy. <br>
<br>
5.) I have a creature with zero energy in play, can it still act like <br>
a normal creature? Basically can it be the target of my spells such <br>
as Heal and be forced to attack by say Will of Orothe? <br>
<br>
RT - Any Creature that can keep itself in play with 0E generally has text <br>
stating that it cannot be affected; the Darbok managed to slip through <br>
proofreading. <br>
<br>
6.) I cast Heal giving one energy to Lesser Darbok the rest to my <br>
Sikra. So now my Tangle does nothing but he is still attached to the <br>
Wasperine? The lesser darbok is now attacked by a Furok which defeats <br>
it, again. Can the lesser darbok be attached to two different <br>
targets? Did it ever stop being attached to the Wasperine? Since the <br>
Wasperine was affected by the first Tangle and now Tangle has <br>
triggered again and hit a Furok are both creatures affected by <br>
Tangle? <br>
<br>
RT - The Lesser Darbok cannot be affected. <br>
<br>
----- <br>
9. Does Gumph's effect trigger when it is itself discarded from play? <br>
<br>
RT - No. <br>
<br>
If my opponent has no creatures in play and my Gumph triggers, must I <br>
hurt one of my own creatures? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes. <br>
<br>
If my opponent has a Dagok and I have a Gumph, can I choose to have <br>
my Gumph hurt itself rather than give energy to my opponent's <br>
creature? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes. <br>
<br>
Once per turn means once per Gumph, right? If I have all three Gumphs <br>
in play I can use their effect up to three times that turn as long as <br>
I have three triggers, right? Or can they all trigger on one card <br>
being discarded from play? <br>
<br>
RT - If you have three Gumphs in play, they must all trigger upon a <br>
Creature discard because they do not say "may". <br>
----- <br>
10. What REALLY happens when a Weebo targets a Dagok? If the Dagok is <br>
not below it's starting energy, can the Weebo even touch it? The <br>
wording on Weebo is "choose one creature in play with less than it's <br>
starting energy..." If a Dagok is at three energy and a Weebo hits <br>
it, does the Dagok lose only two energy? <br>
<br>
RT - The Weebo attempts to return the Dagok to it's starting energy. <br>
If it has three, it would lose two, because the Weebo would try and add two, <br>
but Dream Inversion turns it into energy loss instead. <br>
<br>
What if the Weebo is controlled by a Cald magi with Scroll of Fire? <br>
<br>
RT - The Weebo would still try to add two, which is unaffected by the <br>
Scroll of Fire. After all of your effects are used, the opponent's <br>
turn kicks in and it is changed to energy loss. <br>
<br>
What if Sunburn is attached to the Dagok? <br>
<br>
RT - The Weebo would still try to add two, but since Sunburn says <br>
whenever, it is always checking for energy loss. When the energy gain is <br>
changed to removal, the Sunburn kicks in and adds to it. <br>
<br>
If Flame Saver Tryn is controlling the Weebo and she uses her power <br>
to turn energy discard into energy adding, would the Weebo end up <br>
restoring the Dagok back to five energy? <br>
<br>
RT - If you mean "she uses her power to turn energy adding <br>
into energy discard", then yes, the Dagok would get restored, because <br>
it would change it back into a gain. <br>
<br>
Don't know if this has been asked yet but can you haunt a Cawh. You <br>
are not gaining control of it you are playing it as if it is in your <br>
hand. <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, you may cast Haunt on a Cawh. In order for you to replay <br>
it however, you must manage to defeat it during your Play <br>
Creatures step, since that is the only time you can play it. If you defeat <br>
the Cawh while it has Haunt attached at any other time, the Haunt and <br>
Cawh are both discarded from play. <br>
----- <br>
11. Lets say that my Dark Twins are defeated, and I reveal Niffer <br>
choosing Weave as her second region. Then I play both Abwin's Quill <br>
and Ritual's Spear. Can I use the Quill's Power to change an instance <br>
of Weave to Core in the Ritual's Spear and then revive my Dark Twins, <br>
since they are only alternate Hrada and I am returning only one Magi <br>
to play? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, this combo can revive a dual magi. Dual Magi count as two magi only <br>
for deck construction purposes. <br>
----- <br>
12. Is Weave Hyren's effect triggered when a weave creature "weaves" <br>
to him. <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; this was Weave Hyren's primary intended use in design. <br>

NON-LEGAL LIMITED CARDS<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS<br>
<br>
Scyalla<br>
Power - Pet Project: Once per game, choose any non-Hyren Creature type. Until <br>
the end of the game, you may play Creatures of that type as if they were <br>
Weave, and all Creatures of the chosen type that you play are Weave Creatures <br>
instead of their original region.<br>
<br>
Lesser Darbok<br>
Effect - Tangle: If Lesser Darbok is defeated while defending, attach Lesser <br>
Darbok to the attacking Creature. While Lesser Darbok is attached, it cannot <br>
be involved in an attack, other cards cannot affect it, and it cannot be <br>
discarded from play for having zero energy. The Creature it is attached to cannot <br>
attack.<br>
-----<br>
1. ok if i have yaki core stalker like magi and i have yaki gautlets <br>
do i get yaki gauntlets like satrting card for yaki core stalker <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, any card that says Starting "This Magi", are available to <br>
all versions of that Magi.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
2. Okay, there has been much discussion about how Scyalla is <br>
different than Entomb and Cleansing such that her Pet Project Power <br>
only changes cards that YOU play versus cards that an opponent plays. <br>
My question is how is the word "play" interpreted in this instance? <br>
<br>
RT - "Play" is when you are taking a card from an out of play area (generally <br>
deck, discard pile, and hand) and putting it into the playing area. Very rare <br>
exceptions (such as Haunt) allow cards to be removed from play but be played <br>
again immediately without them "stopping over" in an out of play area. By <br>
Scyalla's current wording, she cannot play Creatures of the appropriate type she <br>
would be forbidden to play normally because of regional restrictions because of <br>
a minor loophole in the timing structure of Pet Project's region-changing. <br>
Therefore:<br>
<br>
Scyalla<br>
Power - Pet Project: Once per game, choose any non-Hyren Creature type. Until <br>
the end of the game, you may play Creatures of that type as if they were <br>
Weave, and all Creatures of the chosen type that you play are Weave Creatures <br>
instead of their original region.<br>
<br>
Under the printed wording, if you named "Jile" and tried to play a Chaos <br>
Jile, it would not be possible because Pet Project does not make the Creature <br>
Weave until after the "Play Creature" process has begun, and though the card will <br>
be legal to play at some point during the process, it was not a valid choice <br>
to initiate the "Play Creature" process (this is similar to why you cannot <br>
Corrupt your own Magi then play a non-Core Creature; though the Creature will <br>
become Core as soon as it enters play, you could not legally choose to play the <br>
Creature to begin with if your Magi was Core). <br>
<br>
Does it describe the act of actually playing a card or does it mean <br>
the cards that the cards in only your deck are changed? <br>
<br>
RT - The cards in your deck are not changed. Nor are they changed in <br>
your hand. The cards become Weave as they are being brought into <br>
play and remain so while they are in play.<br>
<br>
This may seem like splitting hairs, but this definition can affect <br>
the way some other cards. The first card that comes to mind is <br>
Marella. Can you grab a "Pet Projected" card as her "One Weave <br>
Creature" Starting card?<br>
<br>
RT - No. The card type chosen is only Weave as you are playing it. <br>
Retrieving Starting Cards does not count as "playing" a card.<br>
<br>
How is Chasm Jile affected?<br>
<br>
RT - Chasm Jile, like all dual-region Creatures of the type named, will <br>
become a single-region Weave Creature when played.<br>
<br>
Can you play a "Pet Projected" Creature from your hand when Chasm <br>
Jile is attacked? <br>
<br>
RT - Due to the clarification on Pet Project, yes.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
3. The effects of some Nar cards that causes cards to be frozen <br>
says "Powers on frozen cards cost one additional energy to use". Do I <br>
have to pay 1 to use a Power that does not have an energy cost? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, cards that have no numbered cost have a cost of zero. Zero <br>
plus one = one.<br>
<br>
What if the Power does not have an energy cost, but something like <br>
discarding another card to use the Power, is that consider a cost, <br>
and then the one additional energy would apply?<br>
<br>
RT - If there is no numbered cost, the Power is considered to cost zero <br>
energy. See previous answer.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
4. I was reading the MRP last night and I have a question <br>
regarding "Ummm... No!". I thought it would just save a creature from <br>
spells like Shockwave, Undertow but it seems it is not the case... I <br>
would like to be sure and check if it can be used against Cald <br>
spells. What about the loss of energy? What is my opponent plays a <br>
Syphon Vortex on my creature and I cast Ummm... No! Will it negate <br>
the move of energy?<br>
<br>
RT - The energy loss brings the Creature down to zero energy and the Syphon <br>
Vortex discards the Creature from play. Umm..No may be played, but the <br>
Creature would still be discarded by the rules of having no energy. The only <br>
difference in the end result is that the source of the discard would be changed.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
5. My Zungg is frozen, and at 1 energy. I know if I use Gnaw, the <br>
Zungg will die. Will the 1 energy still be removed from the opposing <br>
Creature, or will Gnaw fizzle, since the Zungg isn't in play any <br>
longer to move it to?<br>
<br>
RT - The energy will be lost from the opposing Creature, but it will have no <br>
destination to end up at. Otherwise, the Power proceeds normally.<br>
-----<br>
6. Ex: You have 2 bograth creatures in play and with <br>
Emlob's 'Imaginary friends', you'll count to have 5 bograth creatures <br>
in play. If one of the 2 you have in play is a glablit, would the <br>
imaginary creatures be core also?<br>
<br>
RT - No.<br>
<br>
Despite the new MRP'ed wording on Emlob, the imaginary creatures that <br>
are added to the total be also core since the glablit states "All <br>
your bograth creatures in play are also core" and Emlob <br>
states "Whenever one of your Spells, Powers, or Effects counts the <br>
number of Creatures or Bograth Creatures you have in play, increase <br>
the total by three". Since they are added to the total, that means <br>
that they count and they should also be core, yes? <br>
<br>
RT - No. Bograth Creatures that do not exists cannot also be Core Creatures.<br>
Emlob only adds to the Bograth total.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
7. If I play with Yaki Core Stalker first, then Sorrowing Ogar <br>
second, and Niffer last, can Niffer choose to be Core, or is the <br>
choice of choosing Core removed with the previous two magi?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes. The deck must only be legal when it is built for both Yaki and <br>
Ogar's restriction.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
8. Ashio's "Weave Twist" says that all cards which specifically <br>
reference Core instead reference their own region.<br>
Sorrowing Ogar's text says that she "may not be played in a deck with <br>
any Core magi."<br>
If I have Sorrowing Ogar in play, and the opponent reveals <br>
Ashio,Ogar's text is changed to "may not be played in a deck with any <br>
Underneath magi." Since Ogar is an Underneath magi, does the opponent <br>
lose, or is Ogar defeated? If not, then is the opponent now cheating <br>
if any other magi in his/her stack is an Underneath magi? What is the <br>
timing of Ogar's text?<br>
<br>
RT - Ogar's text only counts towards deck construction. If the deck is legal <br>
before the game starts, violating the text on Ogar or Yaki does not cause <br>
anything to happen. <br>
<br>
-----<br>
9. You have a Rock Silth and Magam's Ring in play during your <br>
opponent's turn. Your opponent attempts to Shockwave your Rock Silth. <br>
Can you do the following? First, due to the wording of Hide, you <br>
move up to Rock Silth's Starting Energy to your Magi. Second, since <br>
the Rock Silth is still being discarded, you then use Magam's Ring to <br>
restore the Rock Silth back up to its Starting Energy.<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, you may legally do that.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
10. Am I right in assuming this? In a multiplayer game player A has <br>
their creature Haunted by player B's Haunt spell. Then player C <br>
Crushes player A's creature with Crushing Darkness. Player C gains <br>
control of the creature and it gets restored to half it's starting <br>
energy rounded up. Then Player B gets control of the creature and it <br>
is restored to full energy. <br>
Or is the converse true? Player B gets control of the creature first <br>
and restores it to full. Then player C gets a creature at full <br>
energy. <br>
<br>
RT - The Haunt Spell will send the Creature into play under Player B's <br>
control instead of to the discard pile; because Crushing Darkness did not discard <br>
the Creature (Haunt prevented the Creature from being discarded, technically), <br>
its secondary effect does not trigger. <br>
<br>
-----<br>
11. Hi, recently my friend and I were playing a game where he had two <br>
Vraks in play and one other 3 energy creature. I killed the 3 energy <br>
creature, leaving the two Vraks. My question is, are both Vraks <br>
discarded because of its effect? It states that if Vrak is the only <br>
Nar creature in play then its discarded. Technically, since there are <br>
2 Vraks in play, it IS the only Nar creature in play, so are they <br>
discarded?<br>
<br>
RT - By stating Vrak, it is self referential. In other words, two Vraks are <br>
two separate Nar Creatures, and neither will be discarded from the Effect. If <br>
multiple Vraks were to all be discarded, the Effect would have to read "If <br>
Vrak is your only non-Vrak Nar Creature in play, discard it."<br>
<br>
-----<br>
12. If Sand Strands is used to make an Olum Digger Illusionary, will OD's <br>
Tunnel <br>
still allow the OD to attack the magi?<br>
<br>
RT - No; the inability to attack Magi is a specific mechanical restriction, <br>
while the Tunnel effect is more generalized; just as a Burrowed Creature does<br>
not gain the ability to attack if it already lacked it when chosen by the Spell <br>
Tunnel, the Digger's Tunnel Effect does not beat the Illusionary restriction. <br>
<br>
<br>
Can Horizon's Mirage be attached to a creature with Mohani's Imbue Spell? <br>
(Horizon's Mirage is discarded to make it work.)<br>
<br>
RT - RT - Yes, because Imbue-ing a Spell does not require you to play it. <br>
Note that the first time you use the Power, the Spell card will be removed from <br>
the Creature it was Imbued onto, and you will no longer be able to use it as an <br>
Imbued Power.<br>
<br>
Does Laranel's Cold Shoulder protect her Creatures against Powers and/or <br>
Spells that choose more than 1 Creature? How about something that chooses <br>
Laranel and one of her Creatures?<br>
<br>
RT - As long as there is a choice involved, her Effect will interfere.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
13. I have a Sunglare Celphet out in play<br>
<br>
Effect - Reflect: As an opposing Spell or Power removes energy from <br>
one of your Creatures, you may discard Sunglare Celphet from play to <br>
choose a Creature or Magi. Discard an equal amount of energy from the <br>
chosen card.<br>
<br>
My opponent plays a Crushing spell on it.<br>
Can I discard the Celphet to choose my opponent's magi and make him <br>
lose 4 energy. Does this also prevent the secondary effects of the <br>
Crushing spell. <br>
If I have 3 Celphets out can I use all of their effects, to choose 2 <br>
of his creatures and his magi, or any combination thereof.<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, you may; at the time the Effect is triggered, the energy has not <br>
yet been removed, only assigned to be removed. This would also prevent the <br>
Crushing Spell's secondary effect from happening, because the Spell did not discard <br>
the Creature. You may also choose any combination of valid targets in play.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
14. I play a Haunt on my opponent's Lesser Darbok. I then attack with one <br>
of my creatures that has more energy than Lesser Darbok.<br>
<br>
What takes precedence, the Haunt or Lessor Darbok's effect that <br>
attaches it to the attacking creature based on the rule of order of <br>
effects?<br>
<br>
RT - Both resolve normally; being the active player, your Haunt resolves and <br>
you play the Darbok, then the Darbok is attached to the Creature that defeated <br>
it (defeat effects do not require the Creature to reach the discard pile, <br>
only that it be reduced to zero energy), and all other stipulations for Tangle <br>
apply, meaning your Creature cannot attack as long as the Darbok is attached, <br>
and the Darbok cannot be affected by other cards or be discarded from play for <br>
having zero energy. (The opponent can still erase this protection by removing <br>
the attached Creature from play.) Also, to put this to rest before it can get <br>
out of hand, a touch-up to the recent Lesser Darbok clarification:<br>
<br>
Lesser Darbok<br>
Effect - Tangle: If Lesser Darbok is defeated while defending, attach Lesser <br>
Darbok to the attacking Creature. While Lesser Darbok is attached, it cannot <br>
be involved in an attack, other cards cannot affect it, and it cannot be <br>
discarded from play for having zero energy. The Creature it is attached to cannot <br>
attack.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
15. If barak's ring is out will a Brushfire stop it's effect from going <br>
off?<br>
<br>
RT - No; Purity does not require tha the Spells be Cald-only, just that they <br>
be Cald at all.<br>
<br>
If Orlons ring is in play would it cause the player to discard his <br>
dual Orothe/REGION from play? such as hurricane orish, and iceberg <br>
hyren?<br>
<br>
RT - No; a card in play has to be completely non-Orothe to be discarded; <br>
dual-region cards will make the cut.<br>
<br>
One more question.<br>
<br>
Can a Sunglare Celphet reflect mass damage spells like Wildfire and <br>
Flamegeyser, the question comes from the words when energy is removed <br>
from 'one' of your creatures, as opposed to if the word -Only- was <br>
used.<br>
<br>
RT - You may mirror the removal from the mass removal, but only to and from a <br>
single source, i.e., if a Flame Geyser were played and affected three of your <br>
Creatures and your Magi, you could only choose the removal from one of your<br>
cards (3E) and apply it to an opposing card.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
16. When you use Undertow, after the energy has been removed from the <br>
targeted creature, does the Creature technically hit the discard pile <br>
first and then is it placed into the opponent's deck?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
17. Next, can Arderian-Wings be used on your creatures when they are <br>
using a power, for example Xyx Minor's Gathering Clouds, and reduce <br>
the power by two, so you pay nothing for it, or is it just on <br>
opponent's spells and powers?<br>
<br>
RT - No; paying energy for a cost is not removal.<br>
<br>
Finally, does Speag's effect, Watch, kick in even when it gets <br>
attacked, or only when your other creatures get attacked?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, it will receive two energy even when it's attacked.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
18. Can anything bypass Tranquility's protection?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Tranquility is a reduction effect, meaning that, for instance, <br>
Rayje's Sword can Pierce it. This is because Tranquility does not affect energy <br>
loss until after it has been assigned, then changes the amount to be discarded <br>
to zero. Prevention, on the other hand, does not even allow energy loss to be <br>
assigned (the Effect - Resistance is a common example). Tranquility states that <br>
cards that "all Spells, Powers, and Effects that discard energy instead <br>
discard no energy", so the loss is still assigned in the form of removal, then is<br>
reduced to zero before it becomes actual energy discard.<br>

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS<br>
<br>
None at this time.<br>
<br>
---<br>
1. Shadow Cloak's protection power reads : (2) Each of your Core <br>
creatures currently in play is not affected by non-Core Spells and <br>
Powers until the end of your next turn. You may not use Shadow Cloak <br>
on your next turn.<br>
<br>
If I have creatures in play with (for example) a Crystallise attached <br>
to it, what happens when I activate the Protection power of the <br>
Shadow Cloak? Does:<br>
<br>
1) Crystallise get negated for that one turn<br>
2) Crystallise gets discarded<br>
3) Something else?<br>
<br>
RT - None of the options are correct; nothing happens to the Crystallise, but <br>
Protection allows the creature to ignore the effects of the spell until the <br>
end of the player's next turn.<br>
---<br>
<br>
2. I was wanting to know if the effect Starfire would effect the <br>
starting cards that are revealed only or all starting cards as with <br>
the magi that state thier starting hand are two of somthing like <br>
Qullia and Scyalla for example.<br>
<br>
RT - All card effects that mention Starting Cards, such as the Effect <br>
Starfire or the spell Redream, will only affect named cards printed on the Magi, or <br>
cards with "Starting: Magi" printed on the cards. They will never affect chosen<br>
starting cards such as "any one spell."<br>
---<br>
<br>
3. OK, I have a vogo and a Rock Hyren in play.<br>
<br>
Vogo has interrupt which allows me to switch the receipients of <br>
spells directed at me. Rock Hyren says that my spells, powers and <br>
effects cannot prevent Rock Hyren from losing energy.<br>
<br>
If my opponent plays ambush (or any other spell that discards <br>
energy), can I use vogo's interrupt to switch the target of ambush to <br>
my vogo (or one of my other creatures) instead?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Vogo's effect Interrupt activates "whenever an opposing Spell or <br>
Power CHOOSES only one of your other Creatures in play," which is well before <br>
the Spell or Power resolves, and therefore well before any energy loss is <br>
allocated.<br>
---<br>
<br>
4. I have a question, If one of my creatures is burrowed, and I have a <br>
card that says "Burrowed creatures can attack normally", when I <br>
attack, do I take energy off the defending creature equal to my <br>
energy and take 2 energy off me, or do I take off 2 energy from both <br>
creature?<br>
<br>
RT - A burrowed Creature, when in an attack, will remove energy equal to it's <br>
current energy, and will lose no more than two energy from the opposing <br>
Creature (possibly less if the burrowed Creature has already lost energy that turn <br>
from opposing cards).<br>
---<br>
<br>
5. Say in this instance that one of my creatures takes more than the others - <br>
perhaps there are two sunburns on it, or somehow cald spells remove twice as <br>
much energy from it for some reason. When a Sunglare Celphet is discarded in <br>
response to mass removal, can the Celphet's controller choose the creature of <br>
theirs that is taking the most damage to be the one mirrored by the Celphet?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, you may choose any one of your Creatures to Reflect energy removal <br>
from.<br>
---<br>
<br>
6. My son and I just started playing using D'resh and Nar decks. <br>
The game so far is entertaining, but neither of us can find out<br>
exactly what "frozen" refers to. I've read the rulebook numerous<br>
times and cannot find what this term means. As a lot of Nar effects<br>
are for "frozen" cards, we think we're missing something important.<br>
Please help, and thanks in advance!<br>
<br>
RT - "Frozen" is a status that is inflicted by certain Nar cards such as <br>
Essence of Frost, Yaromant, and Zyavu. These cards generally have the "Arctic" <br>
descriptor in their title under their name, and often freeze all of one category <br>
of card (such as All Creatures). While a card is frozen, all Powers on that <br>
card cost one additional energy to use. If a Magi is frozen, in addition to <br>
their Powers costing one more, Spells cost the frozen Magi one additional energy <br>
to play. The effects of being Frozen are always listed in the un-named <br>
Effect on the card which inflicts the Frozen status. See <A HREF="http://www.magi-nation.com/duel/Cardlists/images/VOTS/essenceoffrost_rr_vs.jpg"><br>
http://www.magi-nation.com/duel/Cardlists/images/VOTS/essenceoffrost_rr_vs.jpg</A> for an example of an <br>
Arctic card.<br>
---<br>
<br>
7. Scenario:<br>
<br>
Player A:<br>
Yark (5 Energy)<br>
<br>
Player B:<br>
Speag (4 Energy, That's 2 above starting)<br>
Rehyla-Magi<br>
<br>
A. Player A's Yark attacks Player B's Speag.<br>
<br>
Now, Speag has both Watch & Weave (Which, for the sake of arguement, <br>
I want to put an extra energy ON him).<br>
<br>
Rehyla has the ability Counter-Weave.<br>
<br>
Yark has the ability Diving Attack.<br>
<br>
In what order do all of this abilities take place, how much energy <br>
does each creature have when the actual fight starts, and who wins?<br>
<br>
RT - First, you check to see if all the effects have the same trigger. If <br>
they do, then the active player chooses and resolves ALL of their Effects. <br>
Finally, other players, in play order, choose and resolve all of their Effects. <br>
<br>
In this case, everything triggers when Speag is attacked. The Yark's Diving <br>
Attack is the only Effect that the active player has, so it goes first, <br>
reducing Speag to two energy. Then, the defending player chooses what order to <br>
resolve Counterweave, Watch, and Weave. Assuming Weave is not used, the Speag will <br>
end up gaining two from Watch and one from Counterweave (bringing it to five), <br>
and the Yark will lose one from Counterweave (lowering it to four). The <br>
Speag will lose four energy, leaving it at one energy, and the Yark will lose five <br>
energy and be discarded.<br>
---<br>
<br>
8. I've been confused with the way invulnerability works for a long <br>
time. Can someone tell me what happens if a 5 energy creature with <br>
invulnerability attacks a 6 energy creature with no invulnerability <br>
and what happens when a 5 energy creature is attacked by a 6 energy <br>
creature with no invulnerability.<br>
<br>
RT - It's just like a normal attack, except that you subtract the <br>
Invulnerability (usually Loses One Less Energy) from the amount of energy the <br>
Invulnerable Creature loses. If a 5e creature with Invulnerability of 1 attacks a normal <br>
5e creature, both will try to remove 5e, but the Invulnerable Creature will <br>
only end up losing 4e (5 inflicted, minus the one from Invulnerability), <br>
surviving with 1e, while the normal Creature will lose the full 5e and be discarded.<br>
---<br>
9. Maelstrom Flask says that I play a spell for half cost, rounded up. <br>
My three questions are:<br>
<br>
A) Is the regional penalty calculated into the spell's cost? If so, <br>
is it added in before or after the 50% discount?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, the regional penalty is calculated into the spell's cost. It is <br>
added in before the cost is halved.<br>
<br>
B) If the spell allows me to pay extra for extra effects (Tidal <br>
Wave, Resonate), is this cost added in before or after the discount?<br>
<br>
RT- In both cases, the extra energy is paid AFTER the spell is successfully <br>
played.<br>
<br>
C) Can I play Core spells with the flask? What about spells that <br>
say they can be played only by magi of a certain region?<br>
<br>
RT - Only if your Magi could already legally play those cards without <br>
assistance.<br>
<br>
Second, there is a Bograth Magi, can't remember the name...when an <br>
opponent plays a creature that is not of his magi's region, the <br>
Bograth Magi's effect forces the opponent to discard one of his other <br>
creatures from play. My question is, if a creature has two different <br>
regions, and one of them is the same as the Magi's region, then is <br>
the creature considered to be of the Magi's region? For instance, if <br>
my opponent is Paradwyn and he plays a Mydra, does the Mydra's <br>
allegiance of "Bograth/Paradwyn" trigger the effect?<br>
<br>
RT - The Magi is named Eryss, and the effect is Discordia. Discordia will <br>
not trigger unless the Creature shares NO regions with the Magi, so if Ninx <br>
(Paradwyn/Weave Magi) plays a Mydra (Bograth/Paradwyn Creature), it is treated as <br>
a Paradwyn Creature played by a Paradwyn Magi in this case.<br>
<br>
Finally, I'm wondering about powers that create ongoing effects. Are <br>
the effects of these powers affected by cards that cancel, alter or <br>
are triggered by effects? In other words, are they considered to <br>
be "effects" themselves?<br>
<br>
RT - An ongoing effect is simply a card effect that can persist beyond the <br>
life of the card; cards that were created to undo ongoing effects were <br>
originally intended as "magic bullets" predominately for Rayje's Belt, pre-errata, when <br>
discarding the Belt would not end the effects of Lockdown. An 'ongoing <br>
effect' is generally unrelated to Effects, though that doesn't rule out the <br>
possibility of an Effect creating an ongoing effect (such as a triggered Effect that <br>
requires you to do something at the beginning of a turn, then finishes <br>
resolving at the end of the turn based on whether you performed the required action or <br>
not when it triggered, even if the card is discarded in the meantime).<br>
---<br>
<br>
10. In this order of play, in a 3 player game: Andy (Nar), Tony (d'Resh) and <br>
Sean <br>
(Core.)<br>
<br>
Sean has played Haunt on a Sand Hyren. Andy plays Shockwave to discard the <br>
Hyren. Tony wants to play Forgotten Songs to save his hyren; will the Haunt <br>
trigger first?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - The Haunt states "When that Creature is discarded, play it INSTEAD," and <br>
the Forgotten Songs is played "when one of your Creatures is being discarded <br>
from play by another card. Put the Creature into your hand instead of the <br>
discard pile." Haunt affects the creature AS it is discarded, and therefore <br>
occurs before Forgotten Songs, which merely changes where the card goes AFTER it is <br>
discarded; the Haunt wins, and Forgotten Songs cannot be played.<br>
---<br>
<br>
11. Player A is playing Adis. But during Player B's turn Adis is <br>
defeated. Here's the tricky part:<br>
<br>
Player B would like to use the unnamed effect on Abraxim's Crown to <br>
protect himself from Adis' Haunt Effect. But Player A wants to play a <br>
Spirit of Arderial.<br>
<br>
How is the timing here? Can Player A play the Spirit, or is it <br>
discarded because of the Crown?<br>
<br>
RT - The Spirit is discarded because of the Crown. All defeat effects on a <br>
Magi (along with any effects they trigger) will resolve before a regional Spirit <br>
card is playable (with the notable exception of Spirit of Rayje, which is <br>
played to prevent Magi defeat). <br>
<br>
If Player A could play the Spirit, could Player B use the Crown or would it <br>
be returned to the deck because of the Spirit? Can the Crown prevent the <br>
Spirit? It does not literrally discards the cards.<br>
<br>
RT - The Spirit of Arderial shuffles cards into the deck, it does not cause <br>
any discards from the opponent. The Crown would be reshuffled.<br>
---<br>
<br>
12. The Rules Team can explain the Effects with "Once per turn, ...".<br>
<br>
My doubt is: If I have a Grakaden, I can choose the Spell that I may <br>
cancel or I need choose only the first Spell?<br>
If my oponent play a Fireball in my Magi, I choose don't use the <br>
Grakaden, after in the same turn my oponent plays a Shockwave in my <br>
Grakaden, can I use Grakaden to cancel the Shockwave?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Since the Effect Grounding says "may", you may choose to activate <br>
the effect on any Spell that you wish (assuming you aren't trying to cancel a <br>
Spell that can't be canceled).<br>

1. Q. There is no 1.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Q. My opponent has Everburning Wick in play with a lot of other cards. <br>
I play a Cataclysm. Wick's "Short Fuse" says: As one of your cards is <br>
discarded from play by an opposing card, discard one energy from the <br>
opposing card's Magi.<br>
<br>
a. Does Short Fuse work against a Caty? <br>
RT - Short Fuse should be read as "After one of your cards is discarded from play by an opposing card, discard one energy from the opposing card's Magi." So, no; by the time Short Fuse would be triggered, there is no Everburning Wick in play to trigger.<br>
<br>
b. I am confused about the whole "as" v. "when" thing. Short fuse says <br>
"one" of your cards. Does it also mean "one or more"? Does Caty discard <br>
everthing at once or does it discard one card at a time? <br>
RT - Short Fuse will be triggered for each single instance of your card being discarded under the proper conditions, so if a Beam of Light discards two of your other Relics, Short Fuse would discard two energy from the opposing Magi. Cataclysm discards all non-Magi cards simultaneously.<br>
<br>
c. If it does work against Caty, can I block the Magi damage with a Climbing Staff?<br>
RT - Climbing Staff may be used to stop the energy loss from Short Fuse, but only one instance of it; if Short Fuse was triggered seven times and you used the Staff in response, you would still lose a total of six energy from the remaining instances of the Effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Q. Rayje's boot vs. and arderial magi playing any dual region arderial <br>
creature. Do the boots take into account that it is techinically an <br>
arderial creature, and let it slide. Or, does it see the other half, and <br>
say, "hehe, uh, no."?<br>
<br>
RT - Rayje's Boots sets up the condition where non-Universal Magi can not<br>
play non-Universal creatures that aren't of the Magi's Region. So check to <br>
see if one of the played Creature's regions is the same as the Magi's <br>
region. If it is, it can be played.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Q. I had this question come up while playing last night I was playing <br>
Harror (not the Nightstalker) and played a staff of keepers and chose naroom <br>
now the staff says that you ignore regional penalties but not <br>
restrictions. So is the staff of keepers useless for core magi. If not how <br>
does it work for them.<br>
<br>
RT - Staff of Keepers does not negate regional restrictions. It's usefulness <br>
with Core Magi is pretty much limited to allowing Shadow Magi to play the <br>
Non-Core cards that they are allowed play without having to pay regional <br>
penalties.<br>
<br>
<br>
5. Q. My opponent plays a Hand of the Sky and wants to use it to look at <br>
my hand and possibly play a spell. <br>
a. Can Climbing Staff be discarded from my hand to block him from looking? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes; this interruption of the effect negates it in its entirety, because there cannot be a Spell chosen if the opponent cannot look.<br>
<br>
b. If I let him look at my hand and he wants to use one of my spells, can <br>
I then use CS to stop him?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, because choosing and playing a Spell from your hand affects your hand separately from it being revealed.<br>
<br>
c.If he does this to me after my Magi is defeated (no active Magi), can I <br>
still discard CS from my hand to block hand destruction. Is this correct?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes.<br>
<br>
d. My opponent defeats my Magi, uses Hand of the Sky and I <br>
have nothing to block it. He wants the Beam of Light out of my hand. <br>
Since BOL says "up to", can he just spend the 4 energy to use it and <br>
target nothing? Or does he need a target?<br>
<br>
RT - In this instance, the option of zero is in the range of "up to two", so the opponent has the option to choose nothing.<br>
.<br>
e. Also, am I correct in thinking that Abraxin's Crown would offer no <br>
protection against Hand of the Sky?<br>
<br>
RT - Correct. Abraxin's Crown's game text is only triggered when a card is discarded directly from your hand to the discard pile; in playing the Spell, however, it enters play briefly before being discarded.<br>
<br>
<br>
6. Q. One of your Orothe Creatures had a Crystalize played on it during <br>
your opponent's last turn. You happen to have the Spell card Shell in <br>
hand. Based on the ruling found in Rules Digest 6/27/2003, can it be <br>
concluded if you were to play Shell on your Orothe Creature afflicted by <br>
Crystalize prior to your Attack step, you may then attack with that Orothe <br>
Creature? If not, please explain the difference between this situation and <br>
the one presented in Rules Digest 6/27/2003.<br>
<br>
RT - If you play the Shell on the creature the Crystallize no longer affects <br>
the creature, and should go to the discard pile. <br>
<br>
7. Q. Agram's Staff<br>
Corrupt<br>
Entomb<br>
Hrada<br>
Nagsis<br>
Scyalla<br>
Yog<br>
<br>
The above list of cards changes the original region (singular - i.e. <br>
only one region) of a card. I assume that if the card affected is of <br>
dual region, both the original dual regions are negated?<br>
<br>
RT - Agram's Staff does not change the region of a card at all, it changes the ruleset you use for playing certain cards. Also, the Dark Twins and Cleansing are missing from this list. Finally, the wording of the effect that causes the change of region determines whether or not one or both regions are replaced; for example, Cleansing states "the card becomes the chosen region instead of Core", and so in the case of a dual Bograth/Core card, it would become a dual Bograth/Underneath or Kybar's Teeth card. A similar instance, the Dark Twins would make a Naroom/Core Magi following them Naroom Shadow only, while Nagsis would make that same Magi Naroom Shadow/Cald Shadow.<br>
<br>
.<br>
8. Q. I had my Mosp out, protecting my Agrilla/Baldar combo. My friend <br>
played a Rayje's Cloak. Does this mean that he can directly attack the <br>
Agrilla or Baldar?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; Rayje's Cloak's Effect removes all attack restrictions on Creatures in play, and so a Creature that normally could not be attacked by an opponent's effect may now be chosen.<br>
<br>
9. Q. Lets assume that a Sandsifter and a couple of bone grags are in <br>
play, I play a cataclysm and the Sandsifter sacrafices the bone grag, <br>
would that prevent the full efect of cataclysm? One person said yes <br>
because of the timing issue while the other person says that the <br>
sandsifter does not say that the sandsifter effects because it says on the <br>
cataclym does not have opposing cards affect it. Who is right? <br>
<br>
RT - First we'll cover Catalcysm. Only cards that prevent the cataclysm from <br>
actually being played affect the card cataclysm. Which is all the <br>
"Opposing cards do not affect Cataclysm" cares about. Sandsifter's ability <br>
does not prefect Cataclsym from being played so it still works.<br>
As Sandsifter is being discarded by a Cataclysm ('As' takes place before <br>
the spell, power, effect, or game text actually starts resolving) you may <br>
discard one of your Oracles and the Sandsifter will remain in play while <br>
the rest of your non-Magi cards are discard. You may do this for any <br>
number of Sandsifters you have in play<br>
<br>
<br>
10. Q. Corathan Effect - Betrayal: Once per turn, whenever you gain <br>
control of an opposing card, choose any one Core or Orothe card in your <br>
discard pile and place it into your hand. Only one Betrayal may be used <br>
for each card you gain control of. <br>
Orothe Magi can play Corathan<br>
<br>
If you have 2 or 3 of these guys in play, can you take control of 2 or 3 <br>
cards and get 2 or the items from your discard pile?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, for each Corathan you have in play you may retrieve a card from <br>
your discard for each unique theft of an item, up to once per turn per <br>
Corathan.<br>
<br>
11. Q. Morag's Gift: Can you use a controled creature for this? Like one <br>
that was turned, or Corrupted?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; as with Twee, the Creature enters your hand very briefly, and then being out of play, it returns to the relevant out of play area of its owner.<br>

NON-LEGAL LIMITED CARDS<br>
<br>
-----<br>
ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS:<br>
<br>
Everburning Wick: At the request of Design, we are rescinding the clarification to Short Fuse for the time being, returning it to its printed 'As' timing and maintaining the current timing verb structure. It will successfully trigger vs. an opposing Cataclysm, removing one energy for each card that is discarded, including itself. This is an official reversal to the July 22 digest.<br>
<br>
Elemental Shield: Elemental Shield will be legal to play on August 9th, 2003. Effective immediately, Elemental Shield should read: <br>
"Elemental Shield<br>
Universal Spell<br>
1<br>
Choose an opposing Magi. Until the end of your next turn, your cards in play are not affected by that Magi's Spells, Powers and Effects.<br>
You may not play Elemental Shield more than three times per game."<br>
<br>
Sand Hyren: The effect Light Side will read: "Effect - Light Side: Each of your starting cards cost two less energy to play, to a minimum of one. Only one Light Side may be used for each starting card played."<br>
<br>
-----<br>
1. Lets say threre are 1 sandsifter and 1 crystal vision(an oracle) and <br>
I play cataclysm would the cataclysm discard the sandsifter AND the <br>
Crystal Vision or could the sandsifter prevent the cataclysm from <br>
affecting sandsifter by discarding the Crystal Vision?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, Sandsifter's Effect can protect him from a Cataclysm.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
2. If a card (e.g. Agram's Staff, Corrupt, Entomb, <br>
Hrada, Nagsis, Scyalla, Yog) states "original region", i.e. singular, <br>
is only one region of a dual region card affected?<br>
<br>
RT - All cards that pertain to "original region" can be read as "original region(s)."<br>
<br>
-----<br>
3. When is the last chance that an opponent can use Climbing Staff if <br>
I use Hand of the Sky? I know they can do it when I try and look at <br>
their hand, or when I discard it to play one of their spells. In <br>
other words, can they do it after I pay for their spell? Or, will <br>
that whole last part be negated if they wait until I choose a spell <br>
to play?<br>
<br>
RT - Climbing Staff can be used either to prevent your opponent from looking in your hand, or as they select a spell to play. It cannot be used after costs have been paid for the Spell.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
4. Here's an Abraxin's Crown question for you, again with a Hand of <br>
the Sky mix to it. If I use Hand of the Sky to play a Crushing Heat <br>
from their hand, will it have any effect on their ability to use an <br>
Abraxin's Crown from their hand if I play a Storm of Fishes? I know <br>
it would effect their relics in play. I was just curious if they <br>
could still respond with the relic from their hand after a Crushing <br>
Heat discards one of their creatures.<br>
<br>
RT - Crushing Heat stops Powers and Effects. Unlike Climbing Staff, the Crown's protective text is not an Effect, and is therefore unaffected by Crushing Heat.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
5a. Does Volcano Hyren's power add an imaginary, additional text to the <br>
next Cald Spell played? <br>
<br>
RT - No, Volcano Hyren's power text stays right where it is. However, the power text does modify the effect of the spell, as it says.<br>
<br>
5b. If so, are the bonuses it gives affected in any way by conditions of the spell itself? For example, if I use Confulgeration(sp?) and then play a Lava Flow, does it deal an unpreventable 3e to one creature and also unpreventable 1e to the other creatures? <br>
<br>
RT - The "additional energy" removed due to Conflagration has the same traits as the spell that it is modifying. <br>
<br>
5c. Also, does Valkan increase the 1e "spread" damage done by the "boosted" spell? <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, Pyromancy (from either Valkan or Scroll of Fire) will further modify the "spread" energy removed.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
6. Bograth Shifty abilities: This ability says that it loses no energy from opposing effects...so does this include enemy attacks too?<br>
<br>
RT - No, Shifty only works on Effects (capital E).<br>
<br>
-----<br>
7. I was recently testing out my Paradwyn stalker deck against my Nar <br>
frostbite deck, after a twiking on the stalker. The Nar magi in play <br>
was Laranel and a Stalker Boots was in play. My question is when <br>
triggering the Stalker Boots power do you have to pay the 1e for <br>
Laranel's ability? I didn't because the Stalk effect would trigger <br>
when Laranel's creatures were attacked, not as a power or spell <br>
directed at the creature.<br>
<br>
RT - Stalker's Boots Power is used during the first PSR, and affects all attacked Creatures. It does not choose a target, so Laranel's Cold Shoulder will not trigger.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
8. when a chaos plith defeats a creature in an attack and has defeated <br>
itself as well, does it's effect still process to draw a card, or does it have to survive the attack?<br>
<br>
RT - It has to survive the attack to use its effect.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
9. when using crushing darkness to play an opponent's creature, does it <br>
trigger the effect on corathan and similar cards? if yes, would severos <br>
work just the same?<br>
<br>
RT - No, neither Crushing Darkness nor Severos 'steals' a creature, they both play the creature after it is discarded. <br>
<br>
-----<br>
10. when the "horrible dreams" effect of the nightmare hyren triggers at<br>
the beginning of ur turn and happens to remove the last of ur magi's energy from the board, is ur magi defeated first before energizing? if yes, does the turn end or r u allowed to flip ur next magi?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, in this odd situation your magi would be defeated before energizing, as the Energize Step happens after the beginning of turn. This is implied on p.19 of the VotS rulebook and covered again on p.25. In this case, as normal when your magi dies on your own turn, you do not reveal a new magi until your following turn.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
11. is storm of fishes "staffable" in any circumstance?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes; if the Storm of Fishes is the last card the opponent plays, then they have no cards in hand for the Storm to affect. This means that the Storm is now only affecting your hand, and so you may negate it with the Climbing Staff.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
12. can damaging effects from creatures that enter play (koil, shadow <br>
hyren, bulabantu, etc.) discard a wellisk/phrup from play before they can pop to discard/cancel the creature being played?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No; Phrup would trigger first (As timing), then Wellisk (Immediately After timing), and finally Koil/Bulabantu (When timing). To refresh everyone's memory:<br>
<br>
As - When the card is revealed or event declared, after all costs are played, but before a card resolves/enters play.<br>
<br>
When/Whenever - After the card or event in question has resolved.<br>
<br>
Immediately after - Same as When/Whenever, but before anything else can <br>
happen, evern other 'immediately after' effects.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
13. there was some kind of ruling limiting the use of the construct's robe of ages effect so that it no longer stacks. what is the official ruling and how does it effect other mutiple cost reducing effects in play at once...(robes+ythra/construct/arderial shadow geyser/tempest hyren/etc.)?<br>
<br>
RT - Cost reduction effects can stack, but the cost cannot be reduced to less than the highest minimum stated among them.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
14. If your opponent is on Sorreah and you reveal Bria, can you get a Climbing Staff as one of her starting cards and use it to stop Sorreah's effect soon enough to be able to choose a region for Bria's reveal <br>
triggered effect?<br>
<br>
RT - No; Bria's Effect would trigger and resolve before you would retrieve starting cards.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
15. I have a question about the words "as you play" as in "as you play<br>
X card increase or decreace starting energy by up to X2 until Y". Dose<br>
that mean when you play the card from your hand? Or, if X is a<br>
creature card, play the card as in use the power or attack with the<br>
creature?<br>
<br>
RT - Just like it sounds, "as you play" means as you are moving the card from an out-of-play area (hand, deck, discard pile) into play (normally this will be during your Play Creatures step).<br>
<br>
-----<br>
16. Climbing Staff Vs Orothe Shadow Geyser: If I played an Core relic and my opponent play a Climbing Staff, would the Climbing Staff interrupt for the one use, or the entire spell for ever?<br>
<br>
RT - The Climbing Staff affects the Geyser in such a way as "The Spell does nothing." The Geyser is plugged indefinitely. However, you may only use the Staff if you don't have any Orothe or Universal Relics in play, because the Geyser is always affecting them as well.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
17. can the three leaf clover be discarded to nullify trug's cataclysm?<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, Lotta Lucky can prevent your cards from being affected by Trug's Cataclysm. It does not "nullify" precisely, since the Cataclysm will still affect all other magi's cards.<br>
<br>

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS <br>
<br>
Recently, we have received numerous complaints about changes to the timing structure and other of the more 'fundamental' Magi-Nation rules; many feel that these changes are unwarranted. However, most of these changes do not impact the way most players play the game. Additionally, there is a much more practical reason for it: Second Order.<br>
<br>
What is happening is the beginning of what can be called a "transition period". Unlike most other card games that ambush players with a new edition and new rules, we are trying to steadily leak the more significant of the changes or at least how they and existing cards function within them.<br>
<br>
Chief among them that we hope to remove a lot of headaches, will actually first be seen in Traitor's Reach. This being, of course, the complete abandonment of the various timing terms; instead of "as, when, whenever" etc., future Magi-Nation printings will simply tell you on a case by case basis exactly where they open a timing window, and while there will be some new words associated with timing, these words won't dictate it nearly as "logic specific" as the current terms.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, the following cards need a transitional clarification to their wordings:<br>
<br>
Furok: Effect - Retrieve: As a defending Creature removes energy from <br>
Furok place half that energy, rounded up, back on your Magi.<br>
<br>
Orok: Effect - Undermine: As Orok loses energy in an attack, choose <br>
any one Magi in play. Discard half as much energy as Orok loses from <br>
the chosen Magi, rounded down.<br>
<br>
Dark Furok: Effect - Revile: As Dark Furok attacks and loses energy, <br>
discard half that amount of energy, rounded down, from any one <br>
Creature in play.<br>
<br>
Mowat: Effect - Prickly: As an opposing Creature removes energy from <br>
Mowat, remove one energy from that Creature.<br>
<br>
Drought: there seems to have been some confusion over the effect of Drought's wording; for the sake of ease, its text may be treated as saying "The next time each player energizes, none of that players cards gains energy from energizing."<br>
<br>
-----<br>
QUESTIONS<br>
<br>
1.)i'm sure this was ruled on before but just thought i'd ask...given <br>
the way that scroll of fire is worded, a spell or power would have to <br>
physically discard an energy first before the pyromancy took effect, <br>
right? so if i have the arderian guard wings/weave hut/stumbling <br>
junjertrug etc. in play, reducing a spell or power's discard to <br>
nothing, the scroll would never take effect, right?<br>
<br>
RT - Arderian Guard-wings and Scroll of Fire have the same trigger essentially "when <something> discards energy from <something>" The Active players effect would resolve first most of the time this would be the player with the Scroll of Fire. The Scroll of Fire would add the one additional energy to the amount discarded by the Spell, and then Arderian Guard-wings would reduce that amount by two. <br>
<br>
-----<br>
2.) In August 2002, there was a Rules Digest stating that Drought <br>
would work on the flip of a new Magi. While the wording on the card <br>
was questionable, the ruling was made to prevent Drought from being <br>
abused by Interchange decks. At Origins and GenCon this year, it was <br>
ruled that Drought did not work on the flip. When I discussed this <br>
ruling with the Tournament Director, he saw the merit of the previous <br>
ruling, but stuck with his decision. I would ask the Rules Team to <br>
review Drought, the thinking behind the 2002 ruling, and publish an <br>
updated ruling.<br>
<br>
RT - Drought negates the next Energize 'action' performed by each player on their cards in play at the time the action takes place, not the cards that are in play at the time of Drought's casting. An Energize 'action' happens for a player when they must Energize all of their cards in play that can be Energized, meaning either 1-Energize step or 2-Flood of Energy. So even if a Magi plays Drought on their first turn before the opponent even reveals a Magi, the opponent's Magi will not Energize on their next turn; similarly, if that Magi flips and defeats the Magi that cast Drought, the Drought player's next Magi will still not get to Energize when they flip.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
3. gia's tome and everburning wick:<br>
when a creature is placed under the tome instead of in the discard <br>
pile, will this trigger the short fuse effect on the wick, or does <br>
the creature have to remain in the discard pile? basically, does a <br>
creature hit the discard pile first before being re-directed to the <br>
tome, or is it directly placed beneath the tome when defeated, and <br>
would either or both situations satisfy the requirement for short <br>
fuse?<br>
<br>
RT - The Keywords here are "instead of in the discard pile" on Gia's Tome. The defeated creature is never actually discarded, and so would not trigger Short Fuse.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
4. three-leaf clover, crushing heat and multi-target <br>
powers/spells/effects:<br>
I.) can the clover be discarded prior to being "shut off" by crushing <br>
heat to prevent the spell's secondary effect from working? the spell <br>
is affecting the magi but the relics are being shut off <br>
simultaneosly, and the effect says "when," so i'm assuming it only <br>
works after the spell/power/effect resolves, but it doesn't hurt to <br>
ask! :)<br>
<br>
RT - Crushing Heat affects the Magi after the Creature is discarded from play, at that time you may use Clover's Effect (which due to it's ability to make your Cards unaffected should be treated like an 'as' effect) You don't get your creature back since the creature was discarded prior to Crushing Heat affecting your Magi.<br>
<br>
II.) will the clover counter multi-targeting powers/spells/effects <br>
like core grag, deep hyren, nalo, wildfire, etc.? what about vaporize?<br>
<br>
RT - Clover will counter multi-targeting Powers and Spells (not Effects!) as long as that Power or Spell affects the Magi; Wildfire does not affect the Magi.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
5. when discarding a card for the lens of truth's power that is less <br>
than the starting energy of an illusion in your hand, but greater <br>
than the illusions cost after being reduced by it's illusionary <br>
effect, could you process the illusionary effect first before <br>
checking for casting costs within the lens of truth's reduction <br>
range, thus reducing the illusion's cost by an additional 2 energy? <br>
basically, if i discard a bulabantu w/ the lens, would a xala cost a <br>
total of 2 or 4?<br>
<br>
RT - Xala will cost two, because Lens specifies "energy cost" rather than the more standard "printed cost", which means it will take into account all modifiers to the 'cost to play' value before kicking in. It isn't an Effect, it's a duration Power, so it goes last in the chain.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
6. Does Flame Plate Armor prevent a Cald Magi from paying one extra <br>
energy when choosing Laranel or any of her creatures for a Spell or <br>
Power?<br>
<br>
RT - See the 10/23/02 digest for the definition of Costs. Laranel's Effect adds a one-energy cost to the act of choosing, and this cost is not preventable with Flameplate Armor or it's ilk.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
7. If this has been answered already please point me to the Rules <br>
Digest that has the answer. Does Rayje's Swords Piercing cut through <br>
Climbing Staff?<br>
<br>
RT - Rayje's Sword does NOT cut through Climbing Staff, or through any other Effect that says "instead does nothing."<br>
<br>
-----<br>
8. if the rule book specifically states that your magi may start <br>
w/ "any" or "all" of their starting cards, this very logically <br>
implies that a player may choose to start w/ only "one" of scyalla's <br>
two different non-hyren creatures, correct? "two creatures" are what <br>
she starts w/...and "different," "non-hyren" and "of the same type" <br>
are what you're restricted to. using this logic, i believe you have <br>
the right to choose to start w/ only "one" of the two creatures, <br>
should she go first in the magi stack.<br>
if she were to be placed 2nd/3rd, and there were no two creatures, <br>
in your discard or deck that share a type, she'll be able to grab <br>
only one just the same, correct?<br>
<br>
RT - Scyalla can indeed grab only one Creature, as long as it is a non-hyren creature. The restriction on it be a different creature of the same type applies to the a second Creature you deem to grab. Just as Sorreah and Tony can grab any Arderial Spell or Creature, respectively, but must choose from one in the discard if any, Scyalla's first non-hyren Creature must come from the discard.<br>

9.) Burrow states that: Effect - Burrow: X(creature) is burrowed. It <br>
cannot attack and loses no more than two energy per turn from attacks <br>
and your opponents' spells and powers.<br>
<br>
Lava Flow states that: Choose any one non-Cald creature in play. <br>
Discard two energy from the chosen creature. Opposing cards do not <br>
affect Lava Flow when it is played, and may not alter the amount of <br>
energy discarded by Lava Flow.<br>
<br>
My opponent has a 10e burrowed creature. I play Lava Flow and target <br>
the 10e burrowed creature. It loses 2e to 8e. I play a second Lava <br>
Flow - what happens then and why?<br>
<br>
RT - Lava Flow ignores the energy loss cap set by burrow. If you play a Lava Flow after a burrowed creature has already lost its two energy for the round, the Lava Flow will still discard two Energy from the Burrowed Creature. Note, however, that Lava Flow ignore burrows cap only if the cap is already in place. If you first play the Lava Flow then play other Spells that discard energy from the Burrowed creature, the energy loss of the other Spells will still be capped by Burrow.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
10.) Ok, I have looked through the archives and believe that this question was not asked. The first part of the power printed on Yaw, a Nar dream creature, states that you first return Yaw to your hand, then it says to choose a frozen creature and restore it to it's starting energy. Can you still use the power to return Yaw to your hand if later you do not choose a frozen creature to restore, or does the part of restoration tie together with 'power cost' for the use of the power? If you could answer this as soon as possible I would appreciate it, thanks. <br>
<br>
RT - Yes, you may; the only cost in activation of the Power is returning the Yaw to hand; its energy is lost.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
11.) 1. If galiant (arderial dream creature) use your power, and your player had two or more creatures with the same energy both gain the energy?<br>
<br>
RT - No; if you cannot choose which Creature will gain the energy "in case of a tie", then because no single Creature can be affected legally, none are.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
12.) Amulet of Sand states that once per turn, when you play a d'Resh spell, discard one energy from each opposing creature. <br>
Sunburn attaches to a creature and whenever that creature loses energy it loses two additional energy. <br>
<br>
I was wondering if I already had Amulet of Sand down and I played sunburn which card would resolve first: <br>
a) Do opposing creatures lose one then sunburn is attached. <br>
-OR- <br>
b) Does sunburn get attached then the creatures lose one, making the <br>
creature with sunburn lose a total of 3. <br>
<br>
RT - The Sunburn will attach first, because "when" timing occurs after all of its conditions have resolved, meaning the victim of the Sunburn will lose an additional two.<br>
<br>
<br>
-----<br>
13.) If opposing cards (3 Fireballs) remove energy from one of my Baby <br>
Furoks with a Lightning Sand effect with Zannah as my Magi (No <br>
effects or spells are disabled in any way) would the stopping effects <br>
stop the Fireball? 2 Fireballs? 3 Fire Balls? Which one would <br>
happen??? Thanks in advanced!<br>
<br>
RT - The first Fireball will trigger all three prevention effects, and the remaining Fireballs remove their energy normally.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
14.) If I played a wasperine (the effect way) and attacked a Sandstone <br>
Hyren (with Woot! as my Magi) which would work the Weebos for Wimps <br>
effect or the Super Invincibility effect???<br>
<br>
RT - The Wasperine would remove its normal amount; the Super Invulnerability would not reduce this.<br>

Tranquility now states "Until the beginning of your next turn, all <br>
Spells, Powers, and Effects that discard energy instead discard no <br>
energy." (It was MRP'd in the 2001 demo decks. Complete list of <br>
MRP's, errata, and clarifications is available in the files section <br>
of this list.) This is functionally equivalent to "reduce energy <br>
loss to zero" (it is an out-of-date wording) and should not be <br>
confused with the similar "instead does nothing." Note that the <br>
Rayje's Sword Effect "Piercing" also goes through Tranquility, where <br>
it doesn't go through any of the "instead does nothing" effects. The <br>
wording similarity is unfortunate, and use of "instead discard no <br>
energy" has been discontinued in future cards for this reason.<br>
<br>
Jip is only triggered by card effects that add energy; Energizing is <br>

opposing card.<br>

Making a Power or Effect do nothing is not the same as being unable to use the Power or Effect; the opponent's Cloak would negate the ability of the Lesser Darbok to not be attacked, whereas your Cloak would not interact with the situation in any manner. <br>

The Lesser Darbok can still be attacked because of the opposing Cloak.<br>

Both possibilities are technically correct. Because all of the effects happen at the same time, and the opponent can choose the order they all resolve, then he may choose the most advantageous order of resolution, i.e:<br>
<br>
-Resolve the Frozen addition first. (This is not an opposing effect, even if an opposing card froze him, since it is generated by a condition, and therefore must be resolved first.)<br>
-Resolve Fury, reducing the cost to four.<br>
-Resolve Maelstrom Flask, reducing the cost to 2e.<br>
<br>
You scenario also works, however. If the opponent had applied Uncork before Fury, Fury would have been inelligible to make the reduction, a final cost result of 4e. Both possibilities have their strategic uses, your opponent just chose the generally "better" option.<br>

Yes, absolutely. Karse's effect looks for cards that "cost seven or <br>
more energy" to play, and a 7+ cost Thunderquake meets that <br>
requirement.<br>
Yes; as far as redundancy is concerned, each Cald Creature has three separate instances of the Power "Spark", and each one can be used once per turn each.<br>

An ongoing effect is any effect that both:<br>
<br>
1 - Persists even if the source card is discarded.<br>
2 - Has a duration and resolution beyond instantaneous.<br>
<br>
This means that an effect that triggers when a card leaves play, then does something like discard energy, add energy, cause a card draw, etc., is not an ongoing effect, because it endures and resolves instantaneously. A card like Shadow Cloak, however, is an example of an ongoing Effect; once it is activated, even if it is discarded, unless it's by a card such as Beam of Light, the Protection persists until the end of its duration.<br>
<br>
With that in mind:<br>
<br>
Crystalize - The card will be drawn.<br>
Grim Goblet - The hand will be discarded.<br>
Frusk - Magic Scent will not allow the draw of a card, because the Frusk must survive through the playing of a Spell or Relic to trigger the Effect.<br>

Yaki may choose to play Naroom cards without penalty or a regional penalty of two. Unlike most other Magi, he has text that grants him the ability to play cards of his home region, effectively giving him the option of playing Naroom cards without penalty or with penalty of two.

Burrow allows a max of 2 energy loss total per turn, from Spells, <br>
Powers, and Attacks. Note that energy loss from Effects is not <br>

No. The Energy discard is a cost of the power. If the Dark Cragnoc <br>
does not have enough energy to pay the cost of Cremate, the power <br>
fails to work.<br>
<br>
Nope; those Effects are not the source of the extra energy discard, they only increase the energy discard of the actual source triggering those Effects. <br>

Emaya chooses an opponent at the beginning of each of her turns. The <br>
rest of her effect is a constant checking effect, rather than a <br>
beginning-of-turn increase. You choose opponent B, who has 3 relics, <br>
and your energize goes up by 3. If an effect puts a relic into play <br>
under her control (Tomorrow's Jewel being the target of a discard <br>

This is a two-part answer: If the creature's power says to discard <br>
ITSELF, and the power cost brings it to zero, then yes, it can still <br>
discard itself as part of the power (Core Grag, etc). <br>
<br>
If the creature's power says to CHOOSE a creature (usually to discard <br>
it, such as Deep Hyren, or add energy to it, such as Xyx Minor), and <br>
the power cost brings it to zero, then no, the creature will be <br>
discarded when it reaches zero energy, before you reach the stage <br>

None of the cards mentioned affect Cataclysm, they merely prevent its <br>
effect. They all interact with Cataclysm the same way they would <br>
interact with Shockwave or Tidal Wave.<br>
<br>
Cataclysm's wording specifically looks for opposing cards that modify <br>
the wording, region, or cost of Cataclysm, things that would affect <br>
the spell "as it is being played," such as Abwyn's Quill.<br>

<br>
<br>
Your ruling that Sandsifter could use his effect was correct, but <br>
your conclusion on how it would work, was not. Combat will continue <br>
normally until after energy has been removed. If this loss of energy <br>
would discard Sandsifter from play, you can then use its Effect to <br>
save it by discarding another Oracle from play. If you do, Sandsifter <br>
will not be discarded from play by the combat (and thus will not <br>
trigger any effects from the opposing creature that say things <br>
like "if he defeats an opposing creature in combat"). However, it <br>
will still be at zero energy and will be immediately discarded from <br>
play by the game rules. As an aside, this process is true for most <br>
effects that remove energy from the Sandsifter, and is particularly <br>
relevant for the Crushing spells.<br>

False. Effects such as Harror Nightstalker, Redream and Ytrha's <br>
Mantle do not interact with they keyword "any" under Starting Cards <br>
(at least not until II prints a card named "Any..."). Risha is <br>
immune to Nightstalker, but never did figure out how Ytrha got that <br>
darned mantle to work. :)<br>

<br>
Your ruling is correct. Stealth does not create a "double-hit." <br>
Rather, it specifically changes the order of combat so that energy <br>
removal is not simultaneous.<br>

Correct. You can always read "Must" as "Must, if able." Most cards <br>
already use that terminology for "must," as far as I recall, but a <br>
few might have slipped by.<br>

Multiple Sunburn cards all take effect normally. This is no <br>

Ythra ignores the Oasis. <br>

Yup. You'll have an Adoring creature Zooming up to the opposing Magi. That's a perfectly legitimate combo.<br>

Not to worry. Powers and Effects definitly DO have the ability to <br>
create Energy. In the case of Energy Band, you would remove one <br>
Energy from your Magi to activate Charge, then you would take two <br>
energy markers from "the bank" (your token bag, your gravel pile, or <br>
whatever out-of-game location you keep extra energy markers) and <br>
place them on the chosen Creature, thus "creating" 2 Energy.<br>

From the 01/13/03 digest:<br>
13. Last night I played a fierce game between Weave and Kybar's<br>
Teeth, and I was wondering about something in the game and making<br>
sure if I did it right....<br>
<br>
I had a Seaweed Lascinth on the field, so I decided to play the Hunt<br>
(all your Weave creatures can attack twice this turn), and then<br>
played Weave Seed (add 7e to a Weave creature, and it can attack an<br>
additional time). So I had a Seaweed Lascinth out for 11e, and I had<br>
it attack three times that turn. My question is, was he supposed to<br>
attack three times, or only two times?<br>
<br>
RT - No matter the order cast, the Creature gets to attack twice as<br>
well as the ability to attack an additional time; the net result will<br>
be three either way.<br>

<br>
<br>
RT - We have 3 Levels of Specific-ness. General (like Rayje's Boots),<br>
Specific (Like Mantle of Shadows), and Magi-Specific (Any effect that<br>
specifically refers to the Magi like Kesia). Magi-Specific overrules<br>
everything, and Specific overrules General. In almost all cases this <br>
specificity really only applies to actions/Effects that set up some <br>
kind of durational state.<br>
<br>
Empress Gia states "If you have Core cards in play, all of your <br>
Creatures may attack, even those that cannot normally attack." (Per <br>
clarification, Empress Gia is not to be included when checking to see <br>
if either or her Effects triggers.) She specifically overrides any <br>
ongoing inability to attack, per card text (such as Speag or <br>
Crystallize), but does not override any one-shot limited-duration <br>
specific effects (such as Crushing Darkness). <br>

<br>
<br>
RT - The answer depends on which Bungaloo your opponent chose to <br>
Dredge up. If he chose the same Creature that was discarded, that <br>
Creature is already IN play at the end of his turn, and cannot <br>
therefore be returned to where it already is. If for some reason he <br>
chose a different copy, your defeated Bungaloo will return at the end <br>
of the turn as normal. If there is a dispute about which Creature <br>
was chosen from the discard, first chastise yourself for such <br>
unsportsmanlike bickering... then presume that the Creature nearest <br>
the top of the discard was chosen to be put into play via Dredge.<br>
<br>
I'll also note that the Bungaloo can be 'returned to play' from any <br>
out-of-play area. That is, if it somehow gets placed in your hand or <br>
your deck during the turn it was discarded, it will still return play <br>
at the end of the turn. It's only when it is already IN play that <br>
the effect fizzles.<br>

<br>
The two phrases are essentially identical, and trigger both when <br>
attacking and when being attacked. The new wording was used to clarify <br>
that Weave is still usable even if an Effect such as Gum-Gum's "Slide" <br>
moves the creature with Weave *into* the attack even though the attack <br>
wasn't originally directed at the Weave creature. Plus, it's a cleaner <br>
wording, which is always a bonus. You may read all instances <br>
of "whenever X attacks or is attacked" to mean "whenever X is in an <br>
attaack."<br>

Each action may be chosen only once. My argument is, that is how the card reads. "Choose any or all of the following... Choose any ONE... Choose any ONE... Choose any ONE..." The most Resonate will cost you (barring external cost increases) is 4 Energy.<br>
<br>
Cards that allow you to pay "any amount extra" will use the "X" in their cost and/or text.<br>

<br>
Hey, all. For those that remember me, I was the guy trying to find <br>
the loophole with Emaya and Osatch.<br>
<br>
Well, this time I have a much more genuine rules question that I <br>
need answered due to some disputes with other players.<br>
<br>
The card in question is Resonate. I interpret it as the card itself <br>
costs 1 energy to do nothing, then you can pay up to 3 additional <br>
energy to use each of it's three actions once.<br>
<br>
Other people interpret it as they pay 1 for the initial choice, then <br>
can pay any amount extra for additional abilities.<br>
<br>
My argument is that if you could use it's abilities as many times as <br>
you wanted, why, then, would players ever have reason to run <br>
Thunderquake, Ebylon, or Maelstrom again?<br>
<br>
Their argument is that when they used it this way in tournaments, <br>
their elder never told them it was wrong.<br>
<br>
So what is it? Is each action of resonate a one shot, or is <br>
Resonate some super Thunderquake/Maelstrom/Shatterwave hybrid?<br>
<br>

OK... Beam of light can and has destroyed shadow geysers. <br>
<br>
Geysers are spells which are in play, which is one of the three target options listed on Beam of Light. Geysers have no listed inherent protection from being directly discarded. <br>

The errata I printed Greater Gargagnor states:<br>

Expect It: If Greater Gargagnor is discarded from your hand or deck by <br>

costs.<br>
Solid: Greater Gargagnor cannot be specifically discarded from play by <br>

<br>
To me, this means that GG can still be discareded from play by Powers <br>

Giant Carillion's power can still discard a GG.<br>
<br>
However, at a recent tournament, I was informed that GG has been <br>
errata'd so that it cannot be discarded from play by powers or effects.<br>

Has there been an errata that simply is not on this list that I <br>

<br>
<br>
RT - Move = Discard Energy from Target A to Add Energy to Target B. <br>
The X in Syphon Vortex determines the base amount moved. This amount<br>
can be modified either up (by such things as Scroll of Fire) or down<br>
(by anything that reduces or prevents energy loss). If the modified<br>
total is greater than the amount of energy on Target A, it removes<br>
only what is on the target. Once the removal is complete, Energy is<br>
Added to Target B in an amount equal to that which was removed from<br>
target A. <br>
<br>
Example: I have Scroll of Fire in play, and you have a Rock Hyren with<br>
5 energy. I cast Syphon Vortex with X=5. My Scroll of Fire's<br>
Pyromancy bumps that up to 6, and then your Rock Hyren's<br>
Invulnerability knocks it back down to 4. 4 Energy is removed from<br>
your Rock Hyren, and therefore 4 Energy is added to my Magi. If I had<br>
instead cast my Vortex with X=7, it would have gone up to 8 and down<br>
to 6... but your Hyren only had 5 Energy, so I would remove all 5<br>
Energy from the Hyren (discarding it), and add 5 Energy to my Magi.<br>
<br>
<br>
> 5. On that same note, if I have no creatures out in play and spend <br>

<br>
RT - All effects of the current action are completely resolved before<br>
checking for Magi death. Creatures, however, can be discarded by<br>
paying a cost, even if the effect would have granted them energy. See<br>

> same "Effect - Name:" that it already has, is it cumulative or <br>
> redundant?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Cumulative, both Effects are usable. <br>
<br>
<br>
> 9. Can Sand Hyren make starting cards cost 0? If a card is already <br>
> 1 or 0, what happens?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - It says "Each of your named starting cards costs two less energy,<br>
to a minimum of one." Activating all triggered Effects is mandatory,<br>
so reduce the cost by 2, and then if the modified cost is at less than<br>
1, raise the cost to 1. Yes, this gives your Starting Cards that<br>
would normally cost 0 an energy cost of 1. :)<br>
<br>
<br>
> 10. Can you play spells, powers, relics and creatures in any order<br>
> after you attack?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No. After you Attack (step 3), you may play Creatures (step 4)<br>
in any order. After you play Creatures, you may then Use Powers, Play<br>
Relics and Cast Spells (step 5) in any order. Finally, you draw two<br>
cards (step 6) and your turn ends.<br>
<br>
<br>
>11. If I use a Tree Hinko to get 2 extra energy the next time my Magi<br>
>Energizes, and then my Magi is defeated before I energize, do I get<br>
>the energy on my new Magi? Does this effect only the current Magi, <br>
> or the the next time any of my Magi energize? It says that flipped <br>
> Magi are uneffected by spells, powers, and effects.<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, you get the extra energy "the next time your Magi<br>
energizes," regardless of which Magi is currently face up.<br>
<br>
<br>
>12. If I have Illusions in play with my Magi is defeated, do the<br>
>Illusions stay in play for the next Magi? I can't find anything that<br>
>says that creatures are discarded from play with Magi are defeated.<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - "All of the cards that the defeated Magi had in play are<br>
discarded." (p.24)<br>
<br>
<br>
>13. On the same note, if my opponent has gained control of a <br>
>creature, does that creature get discarded from play when my Magi is <br>
>defeated?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No, if you do not control a Creature (even if you Own it), it is<br>
not discarded by your defeat.<br>
<br>
<br>
>14. In a multi-player game, if a player is defeated, but another<br>
>player has control of some of that player's cards, say Heart of<br>
>Paradise, does the defeated player take back all of his or her cards?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - You should work this out ahead of time. Technically the card<br>
stays in play (see question above), but you may need to proxy it<br>
somehow if the defeated player is not staying until the end of the<br>
game. Multiplayer tournaments should address this in their floor rules.<br>
<br>
<br>
>15. There is a Bograth creature that I can't remember the name of,<br>
>that when it dies, it attaches itself to a relic, and the <br>
>controller's Magi loses one energy one someone's turn. Does this go <br>
>away when the Bograth creature's Magi is defeated?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - The Creature is called Umbu. "When Umbu is discarded from play,<br>
choose a relic in play. Attach Umbu to the chosen relic..." You still<br>
retain control of Umbu (and he is still a Creature, desite being<br>
"unaffected by cards that affect Creatures"). Per standard rules on<br>
Magi defeat, "All of the cards that the defeated Magi had in play are<br>
discarded." (p.24)<br>
<br>
<br>
>16. Bonus Question. Not that this will <i>ever</i> happen in a real <br>
>game, but if a player has all of his cards that were in his deck, <br>
>either in his hand or in play, nothing in his discard pile, and it's <br>
>his turn to draw cards--what happens?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - You attempt to draw, and get no cards. Note: I've actually had<br>
this happen with a Bograth drawing deck. :)<br>
<br>
<br>
>17a) There's this thing that my friend calls, "re-nig," and I can't <br>
>find an actual definition for the word. It means where a player <br>
>doesn't follow a rule, or gives something away that alters how the <br>
>game is supposed to be played, and for that reason, the game may or <br>
>may not need to end and/or restart.<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Renege: 1. To fail to carry out a promise or commitment: reneged<br>
on the contract at the last minute. 2. Games. To fail to follow suit<br>
in cards when able and required by the rules to do so. "He reneged on<br>
our deal."<br>
<br>
<br>
>17b) I know that there isn't any actual rule on how to do this, but <br>
>if a player forgets to follow a rule and then remembers too late, how<br>
>are you supposed to go about resolving it? We don't really have house<br>
>rules about this and arbitrarily make up rulings about it as we go<br>
>depending on our moods. If there's a standard way of resolving this,<br>
>we'd like to start following it.<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No such luck. Generally, the intent is to either a) rewind the<br>
game to the point where the mistake did not impact the game, or b) if<br>
you can't easily rewind, to resolve the situation in the easiest way<br>
that fails to benefit the person who made the mistake. It's very much<br>
handled on a case-by-case basis. IIRC the tournament floor rules had<br>
a paragraph on cheating and disqualification, but don't at all cover<br>
honest mistakes like "Oh, I forgot to energize my Green Stuff, your<br>
burrowed Parmalag that you attacked with should be dead." "Well, I<br>
wouldn't have attacked you with my Parmalag then, dork!"<br>
<br>
Legend of the Five Rings floor rules stated that if both players<br>
failed to notice the mistake in a timely fashion, then the mistake<br>
was treated as correct play in that instance, and play moved on. This<br>
encourages players to pay close attention to the game. :)<br>
<br>
<br>
>18. My friend attacks my (5 Energy) Burrowed Creature with his (6 <br>
>Energy) Creature with "Effect - When attacking, This Creature removes<br>
>2 additional energy."<br>
>Does the Burrowed Creature lose 2 or 4 Energy? Since that Effect <br>
>only triggers during attacks, does that count as energy removal by an<br>
>Attack or what?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - The creature loses 4 Energy. "Burrow: XXX loses no more than two<br>
energy from each opposing Spell, Power, or Attack." Note that burrow<br>
very specifically does NOT protect from Effects. "From an attack"<br>
refers to the attack mechanic of comparing Energy totals during attack<br>
resolution.<br>
<br>
<br>
>19. And is this any different from Attack related effects like Stalk? <br>
> If my (5 Energy) Burrowed Creature is stalked, and then attacked by <br>
>a (6 Energy) Creature, do I lose 2 or 3 energy total?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - 3 energy. Again, the Effect causes energy loss IN the attack,<br>
but not FROM the attack.<br>
<br>
<br>
>20. "Powers - If a Magi, Relic, or Creature card has the word "Power"<br>
>in its text box, that card can use the listed Power during this <br>
>step. Each card in play can only use a listed Power once per turn. "<br>
>If any given card has 2 or more Powers on it, Diobor for example, am<br>
>I able to use both powers, or am I only able to use 1 power of the <br>
>many powers listed on the card each turn?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Each power may be used once per turn.<br>
<br>
<br>
>21. A spell that removes energy, such as Dessicate; can it be<br>
>reduced?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, the energy can be reduced as the energy removal is "locked<br>
in" once the spell is cast. For instance, removing all energy from a<br>
11e Rock Hyren would remove 11e; but the Rock Hyren would reduce it to<br>
9e. On the same lines, a response Paradwyn spell (Bloom) could add<br>
energy to the creature to prevent its death.<br>
<br>
<br>
> 22. Continuing with spells such as Dessicate; do these count as<br>
>spells that discard creatures? Now, Sagawal says it may basically <br>
>jump in front of a spell that discards a creature; so does that mean <br>
>it can jump in front of a Dessicate, Fireball, or Thermal Blast,<br>
>provided the original target was going to die? It doesn't say the<br>
>word "specific" (as in "specially discarding a creature from play") <br>
>which is why we're asking this question.<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - The Sagawal may be discarded when one of your Creatures is<br>
reduced to zero energy by a Spell, "instead" of the Creature; however,<br>
the Creature will still be a zero energy Creature, and be discarded<br>
anyway. BUT, the source of this discard will then be the game rules,<br>
and not the card effect that reduced the Creature to zero energy. So,<br>
while it would generally be a waste to discard Sagawal when another<br>
Creature is reduced to zero energy and discarded, it will "erase" the<br>
effects of the Crushing Spell (or any card with a similar 'if this<br>
effect discards the chosen Creature from play') and keep your opponent<br>
from getting the secondary benefit.<br>
<br>
<br>
>23. With more on Bloom, can it be used to change cards that look for<br>
>the largest/smallest creature? For instance, let's take Jagged Rocks <br>
>and Abwyn's Quill. If Jagged Rocks were written to reference Paradwyn<br>
>instead of Kybar's Teeth, and the smallest creature in play was 2e <br>
>and the next was 3e (so that the 2e one would be targeted), could <br>
>Bloom be used to bring up the 2e to a 4e (with whatever powers or <br>
>whatnot) so that the 3e would have to be targeted? Or is it the <br>
>original target that is still targeted? This is highly unusual, of<br>
>course, but we'd like to know.<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No, Bloom has been erratted. The correct text is: "You can only<br>
play Bloom during an opponent's turn immediately after that opponent<br>
plays a Spell or Relic or uses a Power, and all actions related to<br>
that card have resolved. After playing this Spell, immediately use a<br>
Power on one of your Paradwyn cards in play.<br>
Only Paradwyn and Paradwyn Shadow Magi can play Bloom."<br>
<br>
<br>
>24. Does moving energy (ie Weave) count as adding energy to a<br>
>creature and discarding energy from another? Therefore, would a <br>
>creature that was condemned by Dryte Fiend's effect lose 4 energy <br>
>when it wove off itself, and a creature that gained energy due to<br>
>weaving could then trigger other "when this creature adds energy"<br>
>effects?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
>25. When exactly do you reveal your Magi when the last one was<br>
>defeated? When you are defeated on your own turn; do you still draw <br>
>two cards to end the turn?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - You reveal your Magi at the beginning of your next turn. You<br>
still draw two cards even if you have no magi in play, unless your<br>
final Magi has been defeated. See pp.24-25.<br>
<br>
<br>
>26. If you have Nightmare Channel on one of your creatures targeting<br>
>the opposing Magi, does the Nightmare Channel become discarded when <br>
>the opposing Magi is defeated?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No, it remains in play unless it is specifically discarded, or<br>
the Magi who controls the Spell leaves play. It simply has no effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
>27. Can you play Brushfire from your hand and then again from your<br>
>discard pile right away? (In other words, spend 4, do 4, if you're a <br>
>Weave Magi)<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Yes.<br>

QUESTIONS<br>
<br>
>a) motash's staff and motash/d'jarvish: these two magi allow cards<br>
>to come back to their hand due to their effects; motash's staff<br>
>states that when an opposing card returns a card to your hand that<br>
>you put the energy on your magi. Now seeing as even though the<br>
>effect on the magi returns the card to your hand, seeing as an<br>
>opposing card triggers the magis' effect does motash's staff still<br>
>allow the energy gain?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No. It is the opposing card that triggers the staff, but it is still <br>
your effect that is<br>
<br>
returning the card to your hand.<br>
<br>
<br>
>b) Anti core creatures (example: darge) and corrupt: this has been<br>
>bugging me forever, when a core magi plays a "corrupt" spell, and<br>
>another magi plays an anti-core creature, what happens, does the<br>
>creature go under the control of the corruptor, does the spell<br>
>nullify, does the spell stay in play until an appropriate creature<br>
>can be corrupted? please explain<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - The creature triggers the corrupt when it comes into play. Corrupt <br>
attempts to take control of<br>
<br>
the Darge but fails due to his Resistance effect, and the spell is discarded <br>
with no successful<br>
<br>
effect.<br>
>c) severos using its power against an anti- core creature in a<br>
>discard pile, can you do it? i mean the creature is discarded, so<br>
>does it's effect still protect it? what about if you have ashio in<br>
>play<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Core Spells and Powers will not affect an anti-Core Creature. They are <br>
therefore immune to<br>
<br>
Severos's Mind Dredge. They are not immune to Core Effects though, so <br>
Ashio's Weave Twist will<br>
<br>
allow Mind Dredge to affect an anti-Core Creature.<br>
>d)ashio's effect: when you turn a creature with an anti- core<br>
>ability, does it refference it's original region still, seeing as<br>
>the turn spell turns it into a core creature, doesn't that mean that<br>
>it's powers and effect still can only affect core creatures?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - If an anti-Core creature becomes Core while under the effect of Ashio's <br>
Weave Twist, then all<br>
<br>
of it's text works as written. Weave twist will tell the card that all of <br>
it's text that references<br>
<br>
Core now references Core. :)<br>
>e) Ulk+ gargagnor: does gargagnor's effect apply to ulk's effect as<br>
>well. the wording is a touch different, but the effect still happens<br>
>at the beginning of the turn, so doesn't that mean her korrits can<br>
>gain energy at the beginning of an opponents turn?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, "The start of your turn" is functionally identical to "the <br>
beginning of your turn."<br>
<br>
<br>
>f) burrow and invulnerability: for burrowing, a creature can only<br>
>loose 2 energy per turn from opposing spells powers and attacks, now<br>
>say i burrowed an athik which looses 2 less in attaks, that means<br>
>when it's burrowed it looses no energy right?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Sorry no. Whwenever you change the results of something by applying <br>
both a "cap"<br>
to it (changing it to a specific number) and also altering the base amount<br>
(such as reducing energy loss), the reduction is applied before the cap. For <br>
example, a burrowed<br>
<br>
Akkar will have the energy loss from any attack reduced by two by<br>
Invulnerability, then the remaining amount (if greater than two) capped at<br>
two by Burrow. (Note for your records that Athik has no such effect).<br>
<br>
<br>
>g) valkan's effect vs burrow: valkan's effect enhanses his spells,<br>
>correct? if a creature is burrowed does it still loose 2 additional<br>
>from the spell if the creature can't be hurt by spells at all?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Valkan's Pyromancy creates additional energy loss from an acting source <br>
of<br>
energy removal, similar to a Scroll of Fire's Effect. Because the<br>
source of the energy loss is increased, any effect that caps that<br>
source (such as Burrow) will also reduce the Pyromancy addition.<br>
<br>
<br>
>h) sorreah/crushing heat/sandswirl vs nagsis: sorreah crushing heat<br>
>and sandswirl cancel out opposing magi's effects. in the case of<br>
>nagsis, when he is defeated and one of these cards has taken effect<br>
>on him, does the following magi not become a shodow magi (same in<br>
>case of the dark twins).<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - If Nagsis is defeated while under the effects mentioned, Possession <br>
will not be able to<br>
<br>
trigger, and the following Magi will not become a Shadow Magi. The Dark <br>
Twins will not be affected<br>
<br>
in the same way however, as none of The Dark Twins' text is Effect Text.<br>
<br>
<br>
>i) gate to ombor + gloves of crystal: i don't know if this works,<br>
>but if i were to use gate to ombor in combination with a 4 energy<br>
>creature (example agovo on gruk) could i bring it in with an<br>
>additional energy, using gloves of crystal, for free?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No, Gate to Ombor reduces the Cost of your Creature. The Strengthen <br>
Effect on Gloves of<br>
<br>
Crystal does not affect the Cost of your Creature in any way. It simply <br>
states "you may take one<br>
<br>
extra energy from your Magi and add it to that Creature."<br>
<br>
<br>
>j) warlum: it says cards you can normally play, does that mean you<br>
>are limited to cards of the magi's region, what if he/she is a<br>
>shadow magi with agram's staff in play can you play cards of their<br>
>original region?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Warlum's "normally play" errata simply means that if you couldn't play <br>
the relic out of your<br>
<br>
hand, you cannot fetch it with Materialize.<br>
<br>
<br>
>k) nightmare hyren + ashio: when nightmare hyren uses it's power on<br>
>an opposing creature when ashio is in play, does the effect reffer<br>
>to the region that the creature is originally from? example: ashio<br>
>is the magi and his nightmare hyren uses it's power on a junjertrug,<br>
>instead does the junjertrug now remove 2 less energy from weave<br>
>creatures in attacks instead of core creatures.<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
>l) thrybe/ mohani and sttachment spells (sunburn/ sandswirl) since<br>
>you have to place the spell on the opposing creature how does that<br>
>work, can you still use the spell as a power on your creature<br>
>without attaching the spell?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Not exactly. If you Imbue an attachment spell on one of your <br>
creatures, then use that spell as<br>
<br>
a power, you end up attaching the Creature (with the spell) just as you <br>
would have attached the<br>
<br>
spell.<br>
<br>
<br>
>m) korremar's power: when it says an opponent may only draw one card<br>
>does it mean for the turn or during the draw step?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - As it says "During the chosen player's next TURN, he or she may only <br>
draw one card." This<br>
<br>
affects drawing from all sources, whether Effect, Power, or Draw Step.<br>
<br>
<br>
>n) grubble: can you use 2 grubbles to summon an anti-core creature<br>
>out of your deck?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - You already asked that. No, see answer d.<br>
>o1) korrit & pack korrit + korrit's staff: if a korrit pack hunt's<br>
>with a pack korrit does the pack korrit get an energy as well?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No, Korrit Charge gives the benefit only to a Korrit that is using the <br>
Effect: Pack Hunt.<br>
>o2) how about when a striped korrit pack defenses, doe it get an energy <br>
>too?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No, see above.<br>
>o3) can multiple korrits pack hunt/ defend with the same creature,<br>
>example can 3 korrits pack hunt with 1 furok?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, you can combine Pack Hunting creatures.<br>
>o4) also if i were to<br>
>increase the number of times that furok could attack would the pack-<br>
>hunting korrits get it as well?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No, not unless the effect you used for the increase also specifically <br>
affected the Korrits.<br>
>p)rock yajo: can you just plain explain how that card works? i'm<br>
>confused as to if the text applies to the new creature etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Power - Dream Cross: First, pay the cost (discard Rock Yajo from play).<br>
Then, choose two of<br>
<br>
your creatures in play (one must be Weave and one must be Kybar's Teeth). <br>
Starting immediately, and<br>
<br>
until the end of your next turn, the chosen Weave creature can use any <br>
Powers and Effects that are<br>
<br>
on the chosen KT creature as well as any text on it's own card. For the <br>
same duration, the chosen<br>
<br>
KT creature can use any Powers and Effects that are on the chosen Weave <br>
creature as well as on it's<br>
<br>
own card.<br>
<br>
Simply: In most cases you can put the two cards next to each other, and read <br>
the Power/Effect boxes<br>
<br>
as though each creature had been printed with both boxes on their card.<br>
>q)k'teeb: does it's power allow it to copy multiple creatures'<br>
>powers at once?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - It can only choose one creature per use of the power, but if K'teeb <br>
stays in play long enough<br>
<br>
it could eventually Dream Cross and copy every legal target in play.<br>
>r) Woot: for effect savagery when you say energy removed in attacks<br>
>can not be prevented, can it still be reduced with say<br>
>invulnerability:<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No.<br>
>s)targ'n and invulnerability: for creatures with invulnerability<br>
>effects called something different (example: sandstone hyren and<br>
>super invulnerability) does the creature still gain the benefits of<br>
>targ'n's effect?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No, Enhanced Invulnerability looks specifically for the Effect Name.<br>
<br>
<br>
>t) ahron + chasm jile: when chasm jile is attacked and you defeat it<br>
>in order to play a new creature, even though it was chasm jile's<br>
>effect, seeing as an opposing creature triggers the effect, can<br>
>ahron reduce the attacking creature to 1 energy?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Using the Dreamform Effect to discard the Chasm Jile does not count as<br>
Defeating it. Defeat is<br>
<br>
specifically "discarded from play as a result of having zero energy tokens," <br>
or no energy and no<br>
<br>
Creatures in the case of a Defeated Magi.<br>
<br>
<br>
>u) other spirit spells as oppsed to spirit of rayje: all spirit<br>
>spells say you can only play one spirit spell per magi defeated, but<br>
>spirit of rayje says you may play 3 per game. If you had already<br>
>played say 2 spirit of ombors and you have 3 spirits of rayje still<br>
>in your deck, can you still play them?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Yes, absolutely.<br>
>v) mowat: when mowat attacks a creature that starts the attack with<br>
>3 energy and gains more energy through an effect or has an effect<br>
>that can remove additional energy when attacked (example: beeb) does<br>
>mowat loose enegy<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Mowat's Skewer Effect activates when the attack is declared. Even if <br>
the defending creature<br>
<br>
gains energy after the attack is declared, Mowat will lose no energy in the <br>
attack if the defending<br>
<br>
creature started with 3 energy or less.<br>
>w) 3 leaf clover: a friend of mine said this works, but i used<br>
>trug's cataclysm power and he claims that 3 leaf clover prevents his<br>

>cataclysm discards all cards in play, that his magi can be and was<br>
>defeated, can someone explain if that works or not?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - The Magi is clearly a card in play, and would normally be discarded and <br>
defeated by Trug's<br>
<br>
power. This makes activating Three-Leaf Clover a legal move, and it <br>
protects all of your cards<br>
<br>
including your Magi. Trug really dislikes three-leaf clovers...<br>
<br>
<br>
>x) grej & gate to ombor/ prek & kybar's fang: both of those magi can<br>

>not played by a magi of a corresponding region doen't play it. can<br>
>grej play gate to ombor without it being discarded? same with prek<br>
>and kybar's fang<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - They can play the relics, but they will be immediately discarded.<br>
>y) the prankster and ominous prescence: it says that you can play<br>
>core creatures as if they were kybar's creatures, so does ominous<br>
>prescence work with the prankster's effect as well?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - OP says you may play Core "as if" they were KT... but they are still <br>
Core. Prankster's<br>
<br>
Surprise! effect will not bring them into play.<br>
<br>
<br>
>z) carniverous cave and myka: since she is burrowed, is she affected<br>
>by carniverous cave?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Carniverous Cave does not affect burrowed Creatures. Burrowed Magi <br>
have no such exemption -<br>
<br>
Myka is affected normally.<br>
>a1-1) sorrowing ogar and turn/ corrupt: with her templating rules as<br>
>far as when she plays a core card it is considered underneath when<br>
>she turns a creature, does it become an underneath creature?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No, Turn does not play a creature, it merely changes control of a <br>
creature already in play, and<br>
<br>
turns it Core. Sorrowing Ogar's Vile Memories only affects cards she plays.<br>
<br>
<br>
>a1-2) when using strag's ring with her, are core cards in your discard<br>
>pile, when played as underneath spells, still considered underneath<br>
>spells when checking for "purity" for strag's ring? what about when<br>
>you move on to your next magi?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No, Vile Memories keeps the cards Underneath only while they are in <br>
play.<br>
<br>
<br>
>b-1) in the case of effects adding energizes to creatures that<br>
>already have an energize (case in point: yerthe adding an energize<br>
>of 1 to a baby hyren that already has an energize rate of 2) do the<br>
>energizes stack?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - No, you use only the highest Energize rate, energize never stacks <br>
unless an Effect says<br>
<br>
"Increase energize by X."<br>
<br>
<br>
>c-1) grej & tunnel parmalag: i did this once, but i don't know if<br>
>it's legal, grej adds the effect "invulnerability" to underneath<br>
>creatures, but tunnel parmalag says cards can't prevent tunnel<br>
>parmalag from loosing energy in attacks. but grej adds the effect to<br>
>tunnel parmalag thusly making tunnel parmalag the card preventing<br>
>itself from loosing energy in attacks, does that work or is that<br>
>illegal...<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - That works just fine.<br>
<br>
<br>
>d-1) grej+ akkar: grej adds "invulnerability" to underneath<br>
>creatures, but what about creatures that already have<br>
>invulnerability, does the effect stack?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Both Invulnerabilities will take effect normally. If Akkar is chosen <br>
by Grej, Akkar will lose<br>
<br>
three less energy in attacks.<br>
>e1-1) harror, nightstalker: 2 questions here; 1) harror nightstalker<br>
>says none for starting cards, yet she clearly starts off with<br>
>cataclysm, so does that mean she can't use it or can she just not<br>
>search for it at all?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - It means that Harror, Nightstalker has no listed starting cards on the <br>
Magi, nothing more,<br>
<br>
nothing less. Cataclysm adds itself to Harror's starting card list, so she <br>
may search for it... but<br>
<br>
also cannot play it while Starfire is still in effect.<br>
>e1-2) when harror confronts a magi like<br>
>sorreah who has open-ended starting cards (2 arderial spells, etc.)<br>
>what is the template for that?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Effects such as Harror Nightstalker, Redream and Ytrha's<br>
Mantle do not interact with they keyword "any" under Starting Cards<br>
(at least not until II prints a card named "Any..."). Risha is<br>
immune to Nightstalker, but never did figure out how Ytrha got that<br>
darned mantle to work. :)<br>
>f-1) the creature "twunk" says when a creature that has less energy<br>
>than twunk is attacked remove 2 energy from the attacking creature<br>
>before energy is removed. what happens when you have more than one<br>
>twunk in play and a creature you control has more energy than one of<br>
>your twunks, but less than another?<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Both Timber Effects compare the energy of the attacking creature with <br>
the energy of the<br>
<br>
defending Creature. Only one Effect's condition is satisfied, and the <br>
Attacking creature loses two<br>
<br>
energy.<br>
>g-1) relics: i know this is a dumb question to ask but for relics<br>
>that shadow magi can play of other regions (or any magi/relics in<br>
>this particular case) there's a regional penalty right? i didn't<br>
>really get it for relics, spells and creatures i understand.<br>
<br>
<br>
RT - Per page 28 of the VotS Rulebook, Regional Penalty applies only to <br>
Creatures and Spells.<br>

><br>
<br>
If you use Warpath from Warrior's Boots to bring Colossus into play, <br>
he gains his summoning energy "as normal." Warpath does not add or <br>
remove energy as a result of the Power, it simply changes the timing <br>
and allows you to "immediately play a creature from your hand" using <br>
the normal Play Creatures rules.<br>
<br>
However if you use Whall's Dream Twist (and indeed most other methods <br>
of bringing a Creature into play during the P/S/R step), he is not <br>
played "as normal." Instead, you are instructed to play him and <br>
then "Put Energy onto the Creature" as part of the result of the <br>
power. It is a minor but important distinction that prevents Dream <br>
Twist from giving energy to the Colossus - if you target a Colossus <br>
with Dream Twist he will enter play but receive no energy, and <br>
therefore be discarded.<br>

General Gameplay Rulings<br>
Last Updated: 11/15/01 <br>
GENERAL <br>
    • It has come to the Rules Team's attention that a particularly ugly combination of Hrada and Rayje's Boots and Rayje's Band has been making small but loud appearances at various tournaments. This combination, before the ruling below, limits the average non-Core opponent to playing only Core and Universal cards, all for the minor expenditure of two energy per turn. This is, by far, not within the spirit of the game, and nowhere close to designer intent. The Rules Team is not even sure that such a combo is functionally sound - the official interpretation of how the three cards interract was never given before now. <br>
We'll just call this the Specificity Clarification. Steve will be providing other examples of where this ruling applies. For now we'll focus on the Hrada example. <br>
Basically, specificity overrides generalities. What does this mean? It means that if one card specifically allows a certain card to do certain actions, it overrides another card that makes a general, blanket limitation on what actions the certain card can do. <br>
Hrada specificall allows the chosen opposing Magi to play certain cards. This line of text overrides the blanket Effects found on Rayje's Boots and Rayje's Belt. This means that the opposing Magi is not limited by the Boots and Belt - Hrada allows them to play cards from their original region. Since this directive specifically points at the Magi and says they can play a specific set of cards, it overrides the general blanket restrictions made by both Boots and Belt. [RT 10/08/01] <br>
<br>
    • In those situations where the text of two different cards are directly and obviously in conflict, and no other rules governs their behavior, then the card that was in play first has precedence over the more recently-played card. This is designed to be a "fall-back" rule for unforseen situations that may arise. [TM 01/31/01] <br>
<br>
    • Whenever a Creature reaches zero energy, it is immediately discarded. Therefore, Creatures cannot use themselves to satisfy a Power's discard cost if the same Power requires the Creature to use all of its energy. For example, a Deep Hyren (at six energy) cannot pay for its Hurricane Power (which costs six energy) and use itself for the Hurricane's requirement of discarding a Creature. The Hyren will be discarded from energy loss first. Similarly, a Xyx Minor at it's starting energy cannot pump itself up under normal circumstances. [DT 9/8/00] <br>
<br>
    • There is no such thing as a "negative quantity" in Magi-Nation DUEL. For example, if you only have one card in your hand, and you are forced to discard two by a game event, you are not reduced to "-1 cards in hand" and thus have to make up for that loss by somehow skipping your next draw. You simply discard what you have in your hand and then are at zero. <br>
A similar but different situation occurs with regards to Energize Rates. If, through various game events, you manage to reduce a Magi's energize rate to below zero, the Magi does not gain a "negative quantity" of energy and thus somehow _loses_ energy during each Energize Step. He simply does not gain any. <br>
However, note that with regards to a Magi having a negative energize Rate: in order to bring yourself to a positive number, you must still have to somehow counteract those negative Energize Rate levels if they are still in effect. If you are at -2 Energize, you must somehow bring your Rate up by at least three to once again gain energy during your Energize Step. [SM 05/20/01] <br>
<br>
    • You must follow the shuffle instructions on any card that you are playing even if you cannot follow all of the other instructions. [DT 06/01/01] <br>
<br>
    • "Universal" is considered as a region like all the others (although it has it's own special properties unique to itself). This means that if a card asks you "choose a region" (such as Braggle), you may claim "Universal" to be the chosen region. [DT 10/30/01] <br>
<br>
ATTACKING <br>
    • Attacking with your Creatures is done sequentially. You declare one attacker on one defender, resolve that battle, then go on to the next declaration. Playing Creatures are handled similarly. [TM 11/01/00] <br>
<br>
    • Whenever a card refers to allowing attacks, or working with attacks (as in Will of Orothe, or Digging Goggles, etc.) it is understood that it refers to "attacks as normal," and doesn't grant special attack privileges to something that can't normally attack. For example, if you Burrow an Orothan Flyer ("can't attack"), and then play Digging Goggles, you can't suddenly attack with the Flyer. [TM 01/11/01] <br>
<br>
    • OK, let me simply reiterate. Gum-Gums can *NEVER* infinitely Slide anyway, per my ruling, and per older rulings as well. Any one instance of Slide can't be used more than once in any one attack. However, I'm going to spell out the ruling extremely plainly. If you don't deal with Weave or Gum-Gums much, this probably will never come up in your games anyway; don't stress. <br>
Base Ruling: <br>
Any one Effect activating when a specific Creature is either attacking or defending can activate only once for that specific Creature. <br>
Implications: <br>
    1. If during an attack a Creature ceases to be involved any longer (i.e. the Creature loses the status of attacker or defender), this restriction is lifted. However, if the Creature regains such status, the restriction is also regained, and Effects cannot activate a second time. Example: Your Rudwot attacks my Speag. Speag gains 2e from Watch, and Watch is "used" for Speag. I can Weave Tactics to a Gum-Gum, Slide back to Speag, but Speag cannot gain 2e again for simply defending again in the same attack. Speag *can* gain an additional 2e from when the Gum-Gum is defending, however. <br>
    2. This ruling covers Effects that activate on Creatures outside of the attack as well. Simply put, an Effect can't activate twice with the same situation. Example: Your Gum-Gums Slide from Gum-Gum A to Gum-Gum B, then Gum-Gum B back to Gum-Gum A (which, by the way, can no longer use Slide again; see #1 above). Your Speag sitting on the sidelines gains 2e twice, not three times. The Speag gains 2e when Gum-Gum A is defending the first time, and then when Gum-Gum B is defending. When Gum-Gum A is defending the second time, Speag's Watch has already activated in that identical situation and cannot gain an additional 2e. <br>
<br>
I'd like to explain some of the logic behind this ruling for those of you who are curious as to why such a simple ruling needs so much clarification. This ruling makes sense for all of the attack interactions that occur within the normal course of a Weave game. Take Quallon for instance. Quallon's Effect lets you essentially double the amount of energy moved when you use Weave. To say that Quallon's Effect is universally limited to one activation makes little to no sense - if Weave is legal multiple times, Quallon should activate that many times (which this ruling for the most part allows for). [TM 12/10/01] <br>
<br>
CARD MEMORY <br>
    • Creatures that leave play "forget" conditions on them while they were in play (unless otherwise specified, such as a card Recalled by Orwin), and are considered as if they were new cards when played again. Consequently, you could undream a Fog Banked Creature and it would no longer be Fog Banked when you played it again, even it it were on the same turn. [TM 01/02/01] <br>
<br>
    • Cards that are removed from play do not retain anything, such as energy, tokens, Spell effects, attached cards, etc. These are all are discarded when their "host" card is discarded unless otherwise specified. [TM 02/03/01] <br>
<br>
CARD TERMINOLOGY <br>
    • In qualifying statements, the qualifier applies to everything after it (before the next period). For example, "all non-Orothe Creatures, Relics, and Magi" refers to all Creatures from non-Orothe regions, all Relics from non-Orothe regions, and also all Magi from non-Orothe regions. [DT 9/11/00] <br>
<br>
    • Starting cards, cards obtained by searching your deck (e.g. O'Qua), cards moved to your hand from your discard (e.g. Twee), etc. are not considered to be acquired by the act of "drawing cards." Drawing cards specifically refers to the act of drawing a card from your deck and putting it in your hand when instructed to do so (whether it be during your Draw Step or via the actions of some other event, like Blu's Artifice). <br>
However, the action at the begining of your game where you draw up to a five-card hand is considered drawing cards, and is not considered to be part of searching for your first magi's starting cards. Keep in mind, however, that this action, as well as obtaining Starting Cards, occur _before_ your first turn when dealing with your first Magi. This is important for some Effect which effect draws done _wthin_ your turn. [SM 05/24/01] <br>
<br>
    • References to a general type ("furoks," "pups," "balamants," etc.) refer to any of those related cards when discussing Powers, Spells, Effects, etc. However, starting cards are the actual names of the cards themselves, and as such they are specific. If a Magi starts with a "Xyx" as a starting card, you may not obtain a "Xyx Minor," but rather only a "Xyx." [SM 05/25/01] <br>
<br>
    • There is a distinction between a regional _restriction_ versus a regional _penalty_, which, while related, are not the same. A restriction disallows playing by specific regions while a penalty deals with extra cost(s) when played by specific regions. [TM 05/26/01] <br>
<br>
    • If a Magi has a shared name, or has the Alternate keyword, it's considered the same Magi. So Sorrowing Ogar is Ogar, because they share the same name. Korg & Zet is both of them, because it has both of their names. The Dark Twins is neither by name, but they have the Alternate Hrada keyword, so they count as two Magi, one of whom is nameless and the other of whom is Hrada. [EB 08/20/01] <br>
<br>
    • If your opponent has no creatures and you do, you are considered to have more creatures than they do. You cannot have a creature larger than your opponent's largest, or have one smaller than any opposing creature, etc., if your opponent has no creatures in play. <br>
Conversely, if you have no Creatures in play and your opponent does have Creatures in play, you have less Creatures in play, but you do *not* have a Creature smaller than your opponent's largest, larger than your opponent's smallest, wider than your opponent's tallest, etc. <br>
And if neither of you has Creatures in play, well, then... nothing's satisfied, to say the least. [RT 11/09/01] <br>
<br>
CONTROLLED CREATURES <br>
    • Whoever controls the Creature when it is discarded reaps any benefits of the discard. The Creature is considered discarded from your side and then it goes to its owner's discard pile (or elsewhere, if specified). [RT 05/27/01] <br>
<br>
    • Even if it does not explicitly say so, if you are controlling any cards that used to be your opponent's, it always goes back to their corresponding location whenever it leaves play (for example, an opponent's Creature you control that is Undertowed will return it's owner's deck. You will never have an opponent's card in your hand, deck, discard, or anywhere else besides in play. [SM 03/28/01] <br>
<br>
    • When a Creature is Possessed you gain control of the Creature and only the Creature. You do not gain control of any of the Spells of game effects currently affecting that Creature. [DT 12/08/00] <br>
<br>
    • Unless there is specific text to the contrary, cards you gain control of are yours until they are discarded, removed from play, etc., etc. Whether or not the originally-controlling Magi is still in play or not is irrelevant. [SM 02/12/01] <br>
<br>
COSTS <br>
    • So, Costs are defined as: <br>
    1. Any specific energy costs associated with the Spell, Power, or Effect (such as the (2) listed in the front of a Power, or the energy cost as listed in the top-left corner of a Spell) as modified by other explicit factors (such as the Naroom Shadow Geyser costing less if played by a Naroom Shadow Magi); <br>
    2. Any specific discarding of one or more of your cards, whether from play or your hand (e.g., the discarding of your non-Underneath creatures by virtue of setting off an Ormagon is not a cost, as it does not specifically single out 'your cards', but the discarding of your Warlum to use its Power is. Similarly, the discarding of cards from your hand by you playing a Storm of Fishes is _not_ a cost, because it does not specifically single out you -- it affects all players globally, even if you end up being the only one to discard a card); <br>
    3. Any additional costs as specifically defined by the card (for example, the Naroom Shadow Geyser also has the additional cost of discarding three Core Spells from your hand, as evidenced by the "In order to play this Spell, ..." part of the description). <br>
Costs cannot be modified, negated, or otherwise affected by something unless it specifically addresses costs. So, since Dryte Fiend does not explicitly state that it is effective against energy loss as a result of cost payment, it is not. [RT 09/10/01] <br>
<br>
    • Paying the energy at the start of the power and self-referential discarding are both costs. [DT 06/01/01] <br>
<br>
    • Costs: Anything that negatively impacts cards you control as a result of an action you took. "Negative" includes loss of energy, discarding of cards from play, and discarding of cards from hand. Exception: Actions that have the potential to negatively impact more than one player's card are not considered costs - for example, Ormagon does not discard your own (non-Underneath) Creatures as a cost. And the three energy lost by each of your Creatures when you play Flame Geyser is also not a cost. <br>
Paying costs does not activate modifiers. [TM 06/27/01] <br>
<br>
    • Since costs don't activate modifiers, your Vashp's cost of discarding a Creature ignores Resistance. So even your Core Vashp would be able to discard your Yarothis as a cost. <br>
Think of Resistance as a modifier that doesn't activate. [TM 06/27/01] <br>
<br>
DIE ROLLS <br>
    • If a card action requires you to roll a die, select any targets of that action after you roll the die, unless specified otherwise. [DT 9/18/00] <br>
<br>
DISCARDING <br>
    • "Discard a card" means from hand unless it says from play (or other zone, theoretically), or, with logical interpretation, it implies from a zone (i.e. the Creature says to discard it and obviously it is in play, not in your hand). [TM 10/09/00] <br>
<br>
    • You can't decide to randomly discard a card unless something specifically allows you to. [TM 11/07/00] <br>
<br>
    • If, through the actions of opposing players, you already have cards in your hand when you flip over your first Magi, you may still obtain your Magi's starting cards. After doing so, if you have more than five cards in your hand, you do not need to "even down" to a hand of five; you simply would not draw any additional cards. [TM 11/18/00] <br>
<br>
    • Whenever a Creature goes from play to a discard pile, in any manner, it is considered discarded from play. [TM 03/22/01] <br>
<br>
    • If you are required to discard multiple cards as a result of some single game effect (whether from your hand or from play), all those cards are discarded simultaneously. At that point any Effects that trigger upon those cards being discarded are activated. The same logic applies to a situation where multiple cards come into play as a result of a single game event. [DT 05/03/01] <br>
<br>
DISCARD PILE <br>
    • A player's discard pile is considered "public knowledge" and anyone can check to see the contents at any time, so long as they do not alter the order of the cards. [SM 03/28/01] <br>
<br>
    • During your Draw Step, if you are required to draw one or more cards and there are none left in your deck, immediately shuffle your discard pile into your deck and draw the remaining cards as needed. You may only recirculate your discard into your deck in this manner once per turn. <br>
If you need to draw from an empty deck a second time during your Draw Step, or if you need to do so for any reason outside your Draw Step, you simply do not get to draw the needed cards. There is no penalty for not being able to draw in these situations, nor do any Effects that normally are activated upon drawing a card come into play. [RT 05/11/01] <br>
<br>
    • You only reshuffle your discard pile back into your deck at the point at which you would be normally be required to draw a card from the deck. [TM 01/01/01] <br>
<br>
DEFEATED CREATURES <br>
    • Creatures defeated in combat due to damage caused by an opposing creature do not get discarded by some attack-based game mechanic, but rather because their energy has been reduced to zero. [TM 11/06/00] <br>
<br>
DEFEATED MAGI <br>
    • Players are perfectly capable of defeating their own Magi. If at any time (including during the player's own turn) the player's Magi has no Creatures and no energy, the Magi is defeated. [DT 9/11/00] <br>
<br>
    • Magi are not subject to the instant death rule. You check a Magi after everything currently scheduled to resolve has resolved. [TM 11/07/00] <br>
<br>
    • A Magi can use his or her last energy to play a Creature without being defeated. If your Magi uses his or her last energy to play a Spell or use a Power, finish all of the Effects of that Spell or Power and then, if the Magi still has zero energy with no creatures in play, discard that Magi (to the Magi stack, face-up, where it is considered defeated). Note that this is not the same as how a Creature is discarded immediately for reaching zero energy. [DT 9/12/00] <br>
<br>
    • When a Magi is defeated, all cards in play controlled by that player are discarded. This included Creatures, Relics and Spells. [RT 05/27/01] <br>
<br>
    • If multiple Magi are defeated simultaneously, then they leave play in Player Order (starting with the Active Player's Magi) and activating any 'when defeated' Effects as they do so. <br>
For example, take Sorreah versus Adis; both are defeated simultaneously by a Flame Geyser. If the active player is the player with Sorreah in play, then Sorreah's Suppress Effect ends first when her Magi is removed from play first, allowing Adis' Haunt Effect to activate as normal when Adis is subsequentially removed from play. If Adis is the active player, then Adis' Haunt Effect is still Suppressed when she is discarded from play. [SM 05/01/01] <br>
<br>
EFFECTS <br>
    • The timing rules of Duel dictate that Effects are resolved in play order, and all of a player's Effects are processed before the next player gets to process any Effects. <br>
For instance, Player A has two Coral Hyrens in play. Player B has a Deep Hyren and a Sphor. If Player A uses a Tidal Wave to discard the Deep Hyren, the Sphor would not gain energy until after Player A adds an energy to each of his Coral Hyrens. This is because Player A gets to process their Effects before Player B. Note that each player gets to decide the order in which they resolve their own Effects. [TM 05/10/01] <br>
<br>
    • Effects, unless they say they are only usable once per turn, can activate as many times as you can meet their conditions per turn. For example, if you could somehow get numerous creatures to be discarded from play during a single turn, your Sphor would gain 1 energy for each one discarded. [TM 12/12/00] <br>
<br>
    • Intensify sets up an Effect-like action, IMO. When a Spell is played, then, at the same time as when you process other Effects (Scroll of Fire, Blast Gloves, etc.) you'd process the Intensify "Effect." <br>
With this interpretation, I would actually see multiple Intensifies stacking, as you just process their "Effects" in the order you want. Correct. All doubling effects and powers stack and are calculated in the order chosen by the controller. [DT 05/30/01] <br>
<br>
ENERGY CHANGES <br>
    • The term "restore" is considered energy addition if the total energy change is higher than the original amount of energy on the card, and energy removal if going down. Effects which are trigered upon adding or losing energy would be activated, as appropriate. If a creature is at the same energy level he was before the Restore, then it is considered neither addition nor subtraction, and no Effects activate as a result. [TM 12/18/00] <br>
<br>
    • Regarding game events, the term "rearrange" (or some form thereof) does NOT trigger adding/subtracting bonuses. Anything else that adds energy as a result gets adding bonuses, and anything that subtracts energy as a result gets subtracting bonuses, with the only exception to this being in a situation where energy is merely rearranged. Now, for all such instances, the card must say "rearrange" in some form. [TM 04/29/01] <br>
<br>
    • The term "move X energy from A to B" is shorthand for (and operates identically to) the term "discard X energy from A and add X energy to B." Effects which trigger off of the addition or discarding of energy trigger as appropriate. [RT 10/26/01] <br>
<br>
    • Dryte Fiend does not remove three additional energy when a Creature uses a Power that involves an energy cost. Cards that reference energy loss, discard, or removal do not affect costs. [DT 06/01/01] <br>
<br>
LEGAL CARDS <br>
    • Playing with demo cards is only allowed when using opaque sleeves, because they have cardbacks that are visually distinct from the final printings. [DT 9/13/00] <br>
<br>
    • In playing older Duel cards, unless otherwise instructed through these or other official sources of current rulings, use the text from the most current printing of the cards. This is known as the Most Recent Printing (MRP) Rule. [DT 9/13/00] <br>
<br>
    • Each expansion will have a two week wait period from the time of release until it is sanctioned tournament legal. [DT 04/03/01] <br>
<br>
    • Current policy on Promos is that they are legal for tournament play two weeks after the game expansion following them is released. [DT 04/03/01] <br>
<br>
    • "Cards are played as the most recent printing (MRP) of the card. Special preview cards are legal for play, as long as opaque sleeves are used. Cards from a new set are legal for tournament play two weeks after their release. Promotional cards are legal for tournament play two weeks following the release of the next set. Cards from revised base sets are legal immediately upon release." [?????] <br>
<br>
LEGAL TARGETS <br>
    • An attack cannot be declared without a legal target. Facedown Magi are not legal targets for an attack. You cannot attack simply to reap benefits such as from Lava Balamant's Charge or similar Effects. [DT 9/11/00] <br>
<br>
    • Similarly, Spells and Powers cannot be declared without a legal target. For example, you may not play a Spell that targets a Creature if there are no Creatures in play. [SM 01/24/01] <br>
<br>
    • Unless the Creature or Relic specifies otherwise, it can target itself with an ability. [DT 9/18/00] <br>
<br>
    • Face-down Magi cannot be the target of Spells, Powers, Effects or Attacks that are targeted specifically against Magi. [TM 11/03/00] <br>
<br>
    • A Spell, Power or Effect that targets a particular sub-type of card will affect all of those cards in play. For example, a Spell that says "Add 2 energy to all pups in play" will add 2 energy to all Balamant Pups as well as all Quor Pups in play, both your's and your opponents'. Similarly, a Spell that says "Add 2 energy to all Balamants in play" will add 2 energy to both your and your opponents' Balamants, and also your and your opponents' Balamant Pups. [SM 03/11/01] <br>
<br>
LIMITATIONS <br>
    • If a limit is not specified, do not assume that there is one. For example, there are no limits to deck size, hand size, number of Creatures or unique Relics per player in play, etc. [TM 11/04/00] <br>
<br>
MODIFIERS <br>
    • "Whenever a Spell, Power, or Effect modifies the amount of energy added or discarded by another card, the source of the total energy manipulation remains with the other card, and a new source is NOT created by the Spell/Power/Effect. <br>
For example, Valkan's Pyromancy Effect causes an additional two energy to be discarded when he casts the Spell Fireball, which normally discards only two energy. However, you do not end up with a two-energy-discarding Spell accompanied by a two-energy-discarding Effect. For game purposes, what you end up with is a single Spell that discards a total of four energy. This is particularly important when other cards are preventing, say, Spells (in the Valkan case) from discarding energy. The entire four energy would be prevented, since the Fireball is discarding the energy, not Valkan's Effect. <br>
[As most recently discussed (and the cause for this clarification) the Burrow Effect/Spell would limit the Fireball to two energy discarded (assuming the Fireball was the first source of energy discard that turn for the particular Creature) and the Creature would NOT lose an additional two energy to Valkan's Effect, even though Burrow doesn't protect Creatures from Effects. This is of course because the source for all the energy discarded is the Spell Fireball.]" [RT 06/19/01] <br>
<br>
MULTIPLAYER <br>
    • Question: In a multiplayer game, if a player loses and is out of the game, yet he still has non-targetted 'lingering' spell effects (such as Tranquility), what happens to those? Do they remain is effect until the point where they would normally run out, as if the player were still in the game (for example, a Tranquility would last until the point where the casting player, if he were still in the game, would have had his turn)? Or should we make a ruling that when a player is out of a multiplayer game, all 'generic' spells and other game effects, physically-embodied or not, simply disappear? I suspect the latter ruling would be far less complicated and simpler to deal with. I think a ruling that lingering Spell effects (lowercase e) go away when the player who cast them expires is fine. [SM 06/15/01] <br>
<br>
ORPHANED CREATURES <br>
    • In rare cases, a Creature may be instructed to be put into play during a period in which their controlling player does not have an Active Magi. These Orphaned Creatures are treated the same in all cases as normal Creatures, and can perform as usual during their player's turn. Some game effects, however, are obviously incapable of being done without an Active Magi. For example, if an Orphaned Furok attacks and loses energy, it would not be able to put half of it's lost energy back on it's Magi, as there is no active Magi capable of accepting the energy. [RT 05/01/01] <br>
<br>
    • Orphaned Creature: Exactly. If you have one out during your attack step, good for you, attack with it ;) [DT 06/05/01] <br>
<br>
PARTIAL EFFECTS <br>
    • If a Power, Spell or Effect has multiple unconnected actions, and one or more of these actions cannot resolve, the remaining actions continue to take effect. [DT 9/1/00] <br>
<br>
"PLAYING A CARD" <br>
    • Anything that says "bring into play" or similar wording is considered the same as playing a Creature for all game purposes. For example, O'qua using her Conjure Power, Whall using Dream Twist or Hyren's Call bringing in a Leaf Hyren are all considered the same as if the Creature were played normally from the player's hand. That means all Effects or abilities that activate upon a Creature being brought into play (Wellisk, Robe of Vines, Staff of Hyren, etc.) are activated as normal. [TM 11/29/00] <br>
<br>
    • The "move creatures starting energy from your Magi to your Creature" is only a device used to teach players the game with more ease. In actuality, it is a cost that is paid and then the Creatures starting energy is produced from the "grand ether of the Moonlands." [DT 05/03/01] <br>
<br>
    • Shadow Magi are still from the Core Region, regardless of their former affiliation, and thus their Region is Core. They still have to pay the regional penalties when bringing in non-Core "shadowable" cards so a Naroom Shadow Magi still has to pay the region tax of 1e additional to bring in a Wasperine. In a similar manner, since they still have to pay region penalties on them, they by definition are out-of-region, and thus cannot be played when Rayje's Boots are out. [SM 03/03/01] <br>
<br>
    • A card is played if it goes from a region _not_ in play (such as your deck, discard or hand), and goes _into_ play, by any means -- it's pretty specific. A creature is put into play, Relics are put into play, and even Spells are put into play (albeit very briefly for most of them). Even Magi come into play, although they operate under some different rules due to their nature. [SM 05/29/01] <br>
<br>
STARTING CARDS <br>
    • When searching for starting cards, you look through your discard pile first. Only if the card you are looking for is not there, do you look through your deck. [SM 04/01/01] <br>
<br>
    • If any of your starting cards are not in the discard pile, you may look through your deck, even without the intention of getting a starting card, and even only with the intention of just getting your deck shuffled. [TM 04/01/01] <br>
<br>
    • Starting Cards: All starting cards are searched for and drawn before the start of your turn. You also gain your starting energy before the start of your turn. This means that cards that you draw in your opening hand do not count against the limit imposed by Korremar. [DT 07/27/01] <br>
<br>
    • NOTE: as with all other "Any one X" reference to starting cards, you have to check your discard first to see if any cards in there match the criteria. It does not give you carte blanche to grab any card you wish. if you are looking for "any one creature" and you happen to have only a single Eebit in your discard, that card matches the criteria, and so that is the card you must take. Only if you find no cards at all matching the criteria at all do you search your deck. [RT Summer 01] <br>
<br>
STARTING ENERGY <br>
    • Most definitely we should stick with the number on the card. That way when stuff refers to starting energy (Vim and Vigor, Ven, Ash Hyren, Forest Blessing, etc.) you don't have to try to remember exactly when/how the Creature came into play with what on it, etc, etc, etc. [TM 06/08/01] <br>
<br>
TURN STEPS <br>
    • "Beginning of your turn" is right before your Energize Step. The game pauses momentarily to check for any beginning of turn events. "End of turn" works the same: it occurs immediately after your Draw Step. [TM 04/29/01] <br>
<br>
WIN STATES <br>
    • A win is defeating all three of your opponent's Magi. A loss is having all three of your Magi defeated. A draw is a game in which neither player lost all three Magi. [DT 11/13/00] <br>
<br>
    • If you take an action that defeats both your own and your opponent's last Magi, the game is a draw. [TM 12/13/00] <br>
<br>
"X" <br>
    • If a Spell or Effect as a base value discards 0 energy from a card, Effects that activate on energy removal are ignored. For example, if Valkan Tap Rooted for a total of zero energy discarded, then his Pyromancy Effect would not activate to discard an additional two energy. [TM 10/08/00] <br>
<br>
    • Something like the Dark Ayebaw that says remove x+2 energy will still remove two energy as the 2 is not contingent on the X removing energy. <br>
<br>
    • The variable X can be modified. Clarifying examples: Orthean Gloves does cheapen the Power on Leaf Hyren, which means for X-1 energy it will transfer X energy. Similarly, Robe of the Ages causes Burrow to cost only X and Syphon Vortex to cost 3+X. [DT 9/18/00]<br>
<br>
<!-- \\\\\\\\\\ DIVIDER ////////// -->Magi Rulings<br>
Last Updated: 11/15/01 <br>
AGRAM <br>
    • If Sorreah enters play while Agram is active, Sorreah's Suppress Effect will effectively freeze Agram's Energize Rate at it's current number. He will not be reduced back down to 1. Should Sorreah then leave play, Agram's Effects simply resume where they left off -- he does not gain any extra Energize levels for the period that he was Supressed. [DT 04/23/01] <br>
<br>
EIDON <br>
    • For Eidon, his Effect is not always "on" and doesn't check to add energy until after you've announced the Creature, at which time you had better already confirmed that Eidon has enough energy to play the Creature in the first place. [TM 06/02/01] <br>
<br>
HARROR <br>
    • Harror chooses her Effect's target immediately upon announcement of the Spell, and then chooses the Spell's targets. [TM 05/31/01] <br>
<br>
KORG & ZET <br>
    • If you have a Korg&Zet card as one of your Magi, you may not have either Korg nor Zet as your other playable Magi. Korg&Zet count as two Magi -- "Korg" and "Zet" -- for purposes of duplicate-named Magi. [DT 04/02/01] <br>
<br>
    • Korg and Zet will go into a Magi stack with one other Magi and no other cards. One of the prices for playing them is that your opponent will always know that they are there. [DT 04/02/01] <br>
<br>
KORREMAR <br>
    • Yes and no. He cannot deny you your starting cards, since they are not 'drawn', they are searched for and put into your hand. However, when you go to even up your hand to five cards after getting those starting cards... those he can restrict, because they are drawn. People tend to clump 'get your starting cards' and 'draw cards up to a hand of five' as a single event because they are always referred to together, although they are actually two seperate and distinct actions. <br>
Same goes for stuff like Hyren's Call, Twee's effect, O'Qua's Conjure, etc. -- none of those are 'drawing cards'. In fact, Korremar really only prevents excessive drawing of things that actually tell you to 'draw a card' such as Blu's artifice or during your draw step. <br>
<br>
    • Starting Cards: All starting cards are searched for and drawn before the start of your turn. You also gain your starting energy before the start of your turn. This means that cards that you draw in your opening hand do not count against the limit imposed by Korremar. [DT 07/27/01] <br>
<br>
MORAG <br>
    • Morag: If Morag uses his Power with X=0, nothing happens. There is no end of turn if that turn does not happen. This means that Morag cannot bounce his own relics back into his hand. [DT 07/27/01] <br>
<br>
    • (thefting and thefted relic) Well, according to Morag's text, at the end of X turns the card goes back to the owners hand. So yes, you can use it on a relic that you previously gained control of, but at the end of the original number of turns, it goes back into the opponent's hand, no matter how long you extended it for. So basically, no you cannot extend a theft for anything useful. [DT 07/27/01] <br>
<br>
    • No, the Relics would return when they are supposed to return. The duration is set when he is uses his Power, and remains in force is independant of his continued existance of a Magi, so if he somehow manages to rotate out for another Magi (Turning a GP, as you suggested), nothing changes. The Relics are usable by the next magi until they are scheduled to return to their owner's hand. If the next magi is defeated before they return, they are discarded (and return to their owner's discard pile), because they only return to the owner's hand as a result of their time being up or Morag being defeated (neither of which occured). In the meantime, they are treated otherwise just like any other Relics. [SM 08/22/01] <br>
<br>
ORLON <br>
    • Barls or Wellisks controlled by Orlon do not ignore the Effects of Spells residing on other Creatures, sich as Burrow or Fogbank. The opposing Creature is granted special conditions by Burrow/Fog Bank, and while the Spell is indirectly affecting your Creatures, it is really the Creature that is empowered. [TM 11/12/00] <br>
<br>
    • If a player controlling Orlon with Barls or Wellisks in play is targetted by a Will of Orothe Spell, Orlon's Anti-Magic removes Wellisks and Barls from the whole equation. You can't do anything about them attacking or not or whether they use their Powers. Other non-Barl and non-Wellisk Creatures controlled by that player are still affected, however. [TM 10/13/00] <br>
<br>
ORTHEA <br>
    • If Orthea and her creatures are all defeated by a single energy-removing event (such as a Flame Geyser) they all lose energy simultaneously. As a consequence, when her Effect is activated and tries to move that lost energy to a Creature, she finds there are no longer any Creatures in play, and is thus unable to strengthen them. [RT 02/02/01] <br>
<br>
ORWIN <br>
    • Players have the responsibility of providing adequate means of marking cards if they play with Orwin. A suggestion would be to turn them sideways in your discard pile if you've recalled them already. Also, when you recall a card, put it upside down in your hand. Co-operate with your opponent to make it easy to identify the recalled cards. You may wish to keep recalled cards in your hand separate from other cards (place them in a pile in front of you, maybe?). [TM 10/12/00] <br>
<br>
    • If Orwin leaves play (say, by the use of Giant Parathin's Interchange), this resets all the Recalled cards. [TM 10/12/00] <br>
<br>
    • Orwin's Recalled cards can be Recalled again if they somehow are returned to your deck, whether through recirculation, Orwin's Gaze, Undertow, etc. [DT 9/18/00] <br>
<br>
O'QUA <br>
    • For O'Qua, you aren't searching for a specific Creature when you use her Power. You don't say "now I'll Conjure an Abaquist," you say, "now I'll use Conjure." If you can't find what you were intending to get, you can still get another Creature. Keep in mind that you're not required to find something, however. If you only have one Creature left, for example, and you don't want it in play, you can just let Conjure fail and not get a Creature. [TM 01/01/01] <br>
<br>
SORREAH <br>
    • If a second Sorreah comes into play, then the first Sorreah's Effect takes precedence. [TM 03/03/01] <br>
<br>
    • Most definately. Yes, Sorreah can start with two Shockwaves. [TM 05/29/01] <br>
<br>
STRADUS <br>
    • What it comes down to is that the Creature was involved in an attack (as an attacker or defender) when it was defeated. This is the most logical, simple interpretation of the phrase 'defeated in an attack'. The other way (the way that I think you're thinking of) would be 'defeated by the energy loss from the opposing Creature in the attack'. So yes, any 1e creatures that atack Stradus are 'defeated in the attack'. <br>
Actually, Shteevie's interp was as I had ruled in the past. I can't remember where (it was about Eebit, I think), but it's in line with precedents, despite the fact that those precedents weren't logged anywhere. [TM 07/23/01] <br>
<br>
    • When a Parmalag uses shield (or a Vaal for that matter) and attacks a creature controlled by Stradus, Does it still lose one energy from the effect or is the effect counted as part of the attack? The Effect is not part of the attack. Stradus takes an energy off of the Parm. [TM 06/01/01] <br>
<br>
TONY JONES <br>
    • Read Tony Jones' Favors Power as the following: "Power - Favors: (2) Put any one Relic from your hand into play, regardless of region." [RT 05/24/01] <br>
<br>
    • The different here is that Tony's Effect deals with regional penalties and is calculated as part of the cost of the Creature you play. Say Tony wants to play a Weebo. Tony cannot announce the Weebo if he is at 1e. He can announce it if he's at 2e (or more). Eidon can only announce a Weebo if he's at 2e (or more). <br>
Basically, Tony's Effect is always "on" and basically cancels regional penalties for non-Universal Creatures, even when you're looking to see if you can legally announce them. [TM 06/02/01] <br>
<br>
TRUG <br>
    • Trug is, essentially, a reset button. All cards in play are discarded. A Colossus is discarded, as Trug's Power does not specifically affect Creatures, but rather affects all cards. [DT 9/12/00] <br>
<br>
    • Note that even if there are Creatures in play that would normally be unaffected by Cataclysm, they will still end up discarded as a result of Trug's Power. This would occur not because they are discarded along with the rest of the cards, but rather they would automatically be discarded when their controlling Magi is defeated. [SM 05/27/01] <br>
<br>
VEN <br>
    • Ven's Vitalize Power uses the "restore" directive to add or subtract energy from a Creature, bringing it back to its starting energy. The discarding of energy from the Creature is included in the "restore" instruction, as is the adding of energy. Which you do depends on where the Creature's energy is currently. [TM 05/22/01] <br>
<br>
WARRADA <br>
    • Q. Does Warrada's Dark Blooming Effect activate the same turn she is brought into play? A. Yes. <br>
<br>
WHALL <br>
    • If you use Whall's Dream Twist Power to bring in a non-Orothe Creature, you do not need to pay a regional penalty for it. Any such penalty is subsumed in the cost of the Power to begin with. [TM 11/16/00] <br>
<br>
    • A Creature coming into play through Whall's Dream Twist Power is still considered to be "entering play" as normal, and would activate any Effects associated with that (such as Staff of Hyren, Wellisk, etc.). [SM 01/24/01] <br>
<br>
ZANNAH <br>
    • In Zannah's Charm Effect, the phrase "one of Zannah's Creatures" means only one of her Creatures, not one or more. [RT 10/05/01] <br>
<br>
Creatures Rulings<br>
Last Updated: 11/15/01 <br>
GENERAL CREATURE RULINGS <br>
    • The starting energy on a Creature is, plain and simple, the number listed on the top left. Effects that add (or discard) energy from the Creature when it is played do not affect this starting energy. [TM 06/08/01] <br>
<br>
AYEBAW <br>
    • When Ayebaw is brought into play by Yaki, their Double Strike Effects are one and the same and are not cumulative. Your Creatures don't get to attack four times a turn, just twice. [TM 10/19/00] <br>
<br>
    • Just so I don't forget, we need to make an FAQ entry that remind people that Ayebaw doesn't get a double bonus from things like Solar Flare (probably need to generalize the ruling and use this as an example). [TM 04/30/01] <br>
<br>
CHAOS JILE <br>
    • (regarding the demo deck printing of it): This is NOT an MRP. This is a mistake. Chaos Jile can be played by Naroom Magi. Sorry about that. [DT 07/30/01] <br>
<br>
    • when using stealth on chaos jile...does the jile's rebound effect kick in before or after the opposing creature's remaining energy is removed from it? thanks! <br>
"after energy is removed" is actually shorthand for the part of the attack when energy is removed - that is, nearly the last step when processing attacks. <br>
Now, Stealth makes the Jile remove energy earlier in the process. However, this doesn't mean that the Jile's Effect will go off earlier - it is still keyed to trigger after the "normal point of energy removal." [TM 11/07/01] <br>
<br>
COLOSSUS <br>
    • Colossus is not protected from any of your opponents' energy-discarding actions, just Creature-discarding actions. [TM 03/20/01] <br>
<br>
DARK AYEBAW <br>
    • The ruling on Dark Ayebaw was reversed. You can pay 0 for X and still discard 2 energy. [TM 06/28/01] <br>
<br>
DRYTE FIEND <br>
    • Energy loss, energy removal and energy discard are all the same thing. Dryte fiend does not work when a creature uses it's power that has a cost. Energy gain and energy addition are synonymous. [DT 05/30/01] <br>
<br>
    • Treat Dryte Fiend as if it reads: "Effect - Condemn: At the beginning of each of your opponent's turns, you may choose any one Creature in play. Until the end of that opponent's turn, each time the chosen Creature loses energy as a result of Powers, Spells, or attacks, discard three energy from that Creature." [RT 06/01/01] ADD TO MRP LIST <br>
<br>
ERGAR <br>
    • If two Ergar are in play, all Cald Creatures in play have two copies of the Power "Spark" and can use both Powers once per turn. [DT 05/25/01] <br>
<br>
FUROK GUARDIAN <br>
    • When a Furok Guardian saves a Creature by use of it's Terra Rebirth Power, the Creature is considered to be played as normal when it returns to play, and as such it would trigger such Effects as a Robe of Vines, Wellisk, etc. [DT 05/20/01] <br>
<br>
    • If you use Terra Rebirth to save a Creature, and your Magi is defeated before the end of the turn, the Creature will still come into play as an Orphaned Creature. [DT 05/23/01] <br>
<br>
    • Whenever any of your Creatures gets discarded, through any means, you can use the Furok Guardian to "save" the Creature (at end of turn). It's quite good with Giant Parathin, and even your attacking Colossi that dies in the attack. [TM 07/05/01] <br>
<br>
    • Yes, you can use the Furok Guardian to save Ormagon, because the Ormagon is discarded before the Power discards all non-Underneath Creatures. [TM 07/09/01] <br>
<br>
GIANT PARATHIN <br>
    • Interchange brings in the next Magi in your Magi stack. You must have an undefeated Magi in your Magi stack in order to use Interchange. <br>
<br>
    • The Magi that goes back to your Magi pile is placed there face down and is not considered defeated, nor are any Effects that rely on Magi Defeat activated. The new Magi can use any Relics left by the old Magi, even if they are from a different region. [TM 12/13/00] <br>
<br>
GIANT PARMALAG <br>
    • The Withdraw Power prevents Giant Parmalag as being chosen as the defending Creature during an attack. However, other Effects may cause it to become the target, such as a Gum-Gum using its Slide Effect to redirect the attack to the Giant Parmalag. [TM 01/19/01] <br>
<br>
HEPPESWIP <br>
    • Heppeswip's Unravel Effect activates as any normal Effect -- as a response to an action. It does not prevent that action, but rather 'punishes' the opposing Creature for using their Power. [RT 11/12/01] <br>
<br>
J'LITH <br>
    • If you have a J'lith in play and your last Relic is swapped out for another (for example, through the use of Gia's Unearth Power), the J'lith will not be discarded when the Relics swap out. [DT 05/01/01] <br>
<br>
KARAK <br>
    • If a Karak steals a Relic using its Steal Power, the Orpus' Relic Guard Effect would not be activated, since the Relic has not technically left play, only made innaccesable. [TM 10/13/00] <br>
<br>
    • If Karak uses it's last two energy to Steal a Relic, it will be discarded when it is reduced to 0 Energy, and the Relic will remain where it is, since there will no longer be a Karak to place the stolen Relic under. [TM 05/27/01] <br>
<br>
    • If Trug's Cataclysm Power is used while Karak has a Relic underneath it, the Relic is discarded along with all the rest of the cards; it does not return to its owner's hand. [DT 05/01/01] <br>
<br>
    • Treat UNLIMITED KARAK as if: "Power - Steal: (2) Choose any one opposing Relic in play. Gain control of the chosen Relic and place it under Karak. You may not use the stolen Relic, and it is unaffected by Spells, Effects, and other Powers. Your opponent may not play Relics with the same name. When Karak leaves play, return any Relics under Karak to their owners' hands." [TM 06/16/01] THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE MRP LIST <br>
<br>
    • So Karak operates similar to Morag in that you can't use it on a Relic you already control. [TM 06/13/01] OVERRULED? COMPARE AND CONTRAST <br>
<br>
KORRIT <br>
    • Multiple Korrits on the attacking side can all activate to Pack Hunt off of one attacking Creature. It is not legal for them to Pack Hunt off of each others' Pack Hunts. [TM 11/07/00] <br>
<br>
    • Korrits remove their energy simultaneously with the Creature they Pack Hunt with, and as such, it is considered only a single (if larger) "attack" on the defending Creature as far as Effects and other activated abilities are concerned. [TM 12/07/00] <br>
<br>
    • Any Effects or activated abilities that would affect the Attacking Creature will also affect any Korrits that are Pack Hunting along with the attacking Creatures. For example, a Bwill attacked and defeated by a Vulbor and a Pack Hunting Korrit will discard both attacking Creatures as a result of its Karma Effect. [TM 12/07/00] <br>
<br>
    • Korrits may not use Pack Hunt when the Creature they are Pack Hunting along with is attacking a Magi directly, only when attacking another Creature. [TM 01/19/01] <br>
<br>
    • Korrits may only opt to join in an attack with Pack Hunt when the intial attack is declared. You cannot Pack Hunt later in the attack sequence. [SM 02/29/01] <br>
<br>
    • If you attack a Gum-Gum and you have one or more Korrits Pack Hunting along with it, they also Slide when Gum-Gum activates it's Effect. Although the Slide Effect means the attacking Creatures now have a new target, this does not now allow a Korrit to Pack Hunt in the attack if he wasn't already involved. [SM 02/29/01] <br>
Going off your Binding/Lascinth commentary over on M-Pire, you could Belt Lascinth's Hungry Effect to allow you to disregard the need to attack each turn, correct? Since the Belt is not preventing him from attacking, just allowing him to attack as a normal card might (which, of course, includes the option to not attack at all if you so desire). <br>
<br>
LASCINTH <br>
    • Lascinth's Reflexes Effect allows it to remove it's energy from it's opponent first, as opposed to simultaneously (as is normally done). If Lascinth removes all the opponent's energy as a result of this early shot, then the creature immediately dies before getting the chance to do it's own damage in return. [RT 11/12/01] <br>
<br>
    • It is possible to Lockdown the Hungry Effect with Rayje's Belt. This does not actually prevent the Lascinth from attacking, but rather simply removes the requirement that it attack each turn. As a result, it may simply attack or not attack as would a normal Creature. [TM 11/08/01] <br>
<br>
LOVIAN <br>
    • Lovian's Resistance Effect protects it from all Spell actions, including any that don't directly target it (e.g. Typhoon). [DT 9/11/00] <br>
<br>
OROTHAN FLYER <br>
    • Although it has an Energize rate, an Orathan Flyer is not a Magi. Your opponent does not have to defeat all your other Creatures before attacking the Flyer, and if the act of using the energy from an Orathan Flyer to bring in a new Creature reduces the Flyer to zero energy as a result, the Flyer is discarded as normal. [TM 11/01/00] <br>
<br>
    • Not being able to attack doesn't mean the Orathan Flyer doesn't participate when attacked by an opponent's Creature. It still removes energy from the attacking Creature as normal. [TM 11/01/00] <br>
<br>
    • You may play Creatures with the energy from Orathan Flyer during the same Bring In New Creatures step in which the Flyer itself was brought in. It's Summon ability is an Effect, not a Power, and thus can only be used when it is activated, which is during it's controller's Bring In New Creatures step. [TM 11/01/00] <br>
<br>
    • When using energy from the Orathan Flyer to bring in new Creatures, all activated effects, penalties, etc. still apply. For example, regional penalties would still apply as per your Magi, and a Robe of Vines would still add one energy as normal regardless of whether you brought a Naroom Creature into play using energy off your Magi, or energy off an Orathan Flyer. [TM 10/06/00] <br>
<br>
ORPUS <br>
    • If you have both a Relic Mirror and an Orpus in play, you may choose which Effect activates first in order to save the Relic. [TM 10/13/00] <br>
<br>
PHRUP <br>
    • Any number of means -- such as the playing of a Creature from your hand during your Bring In New Creatures Step, O'Qua's Conjure or even Hyren's Call -- can bring a Creature into play, and Phrup is effective against all of them. However, when Phrup refers to "Any energy that was used is returned to that player's Magi," it is referring to energy that was actually spent off the Magi to be placed on the Creature, such as when you play a Creature during your Bring In New Creatures Step. If you use Hyren's Call to bring in a Creature, which then was responded to by Phrup, the energy used to pay for the Spell would _not_ be returned to your Magi, since it was already spent to fuel the Spell in the first place. Once underway and paid for, the Spell essentially brought the creature in for free. The affected Creature card would still be returned to the owner's hand, however (even if the card originally came from some other region, such as their deck or discard). [SM 05/01/01] <br>
<br>
    • Literally speaking, Phrup does a number of specific things:<br>
1. Discards itself.<br>
2. Returns the card to your hand.<br>
3. If you used any energy from your Magi to play the card, that energy goes back to your Magi.<br>
4. Prevents you from playing cards with the same name again this turn.<br>
(5. It's assumed that Phrup cancels any actions of the played card.) <br>
Now, as worded, this is how Phrup interracts with cards like Hyren's Call, O'Qua, Whall, etc. <br>
All these cards use another card to facilitate playing of the card you'll Phrup. Now, did you spend any energy to put that Colossus in play with Whall? Technically, no, that 12e came from the "ether" as Steve puts it. So no, you don't get any energy back. Similarly, that Hyren's Call cost you 6e, but the Hyren was "free." So the Phruped Hyren doesn't give you back any energy. And Conjure cost O'Qua 4e to use as a Power, but the Conjured Creature got 4e for free. O'Qua didn't use 4e to play the Creature, she used 4e to play Conjure. [TM 06/05/01] <br>
<br>
    • Phrup is used after all costs are paid. Discarding the cards for Implosion is a cost. Phrup does not give you back the cards, of course, and you're stuck with only getting the one energy and the Implosion back. [TM 07/27/01] <br>
<br>
TREE HINKO <br>
    • With regards to Tree Hinko, the phrase "Your Magi" is actually referring to the player ("The player's Magi"), and is not referencing a specific active Magi. As such, even if you lost another Magi immediately after activating the Hinko, your next face-up Magi would benefit when he next energized. [SM 05/05/01] <br>
<br>
    • Tree Hinkos are cumulative and still apply the bonus even if they're discarded from play in the meantime. [TM 05/30/01] <br>
<br>
    • Tree Hinko works on the next time any one of your Magi energizes. It doesn't care whether it's the Magi that actually played the Tree Hinko, no. [TM 07/03/01] <br>
<br>
TWEE <br>
    • If you control a Twee originally owned by an opponent (say, it was Possesed by an Abaquist), then when the Twee is discarded from play, it hits your discard pile, allowing you to gain the otherwise-topmost Creature from your discard pile into your hand. However, as soon as that happens, the Twee is then returned to it's original owner's discard pile (with no further Effects activating as a result of that transfer). [TM 10/30/00] <br>
<br>
WELLISK <br>
    • Wellisk's Dream Barrier Effect can be played whenever a player is playing a Creature by any means, be it from their hand, their deck or wherever. [DT 12/14/00] <br>
Spell Rulings<br>
Last Updated: 11/15/01 <br>
GENERAL SPELL RULINGS <br>
    • If a Creature changes controllers (for example, if an Abaquist Posseses it), any Spells that may have been on the original Creature are still "controlled" by the Magi that played the Spell in the first place. For example, a Fog Banked Creature that changes controllers still retains the original definition of "opponents" according to the Magi that originally played the Fog Bank. [DT 12/08/00] <br>
<br>
    • If a Spell specifically affects a chosen Magi, and then the Magi somehow leaves play (for example, the Giant Parathin's Interchange Power or by being defeated), then the Spell no longer applies, and will not affect the next incoming Magi. Careful, though, as some Spells affect players, not Magi. Those Spells will continue to have their Effect irregardless of who the player's active Magi is. [TM 02/12/01] <br>
<br>
    • When a Magi is defeated, any Spells that the Magi played are also discarded from play. This refers only to physical cards (such as Fog Bank) and not to "ongoing" Spell effects that may be unresolved and in play but not actually tied to a physical card (such as Entangle). [RT 05/26/01] <br>
<br>
    • I'm afraid not, Dr. Bob. Spells work similar to Powers, and once you start the step sequence, which begins with announcing the Spell, you must follow the steps to completion. I guess that hasn't been made clear before. [TM 05/29/01] <br>
<br>
    • 2. What happens if you cast a spell that has no effect? For example, last night I cast Solar Flare even though none of my Arderial Creatures had successfully defeated an opposing Creature. Did I just waste 4 energy, or would this spell have been prevented? 2. The spell has no effect. You wasted 4 energy. [DT 06/01/01] <br>
<br>
    • You can't announce a Spell or Power or Creature if you can't pay the cost, simply to gain some side benefit. [TM 06/02/01] <br>
<br>
    • The description of "spell" in the current rulebook (where it refers to spells being discarded when a Magi is defeated) is a little vague, because it unfortunately does not make the distinction between a _spell_ (i.e., the card itself) that is still in play and a spell's _effect_ that may still be ongoing. <br>
When Magi is defeated, all cards in control of that Magi are discarded from play, and that includes Spell _cards_ that are attached to other Creatures, such as Fog Bank, Nightmare Channel, etc. They are all discarded and their effect ceases to be when their controlling Magi is defeated. This occurs regardless of who's Creatures they happen to be attached to. <br>
However, Spell _effects_ are not necessarily cancelled when their casting Magi is defeated. As an example, if you cast an Entangle on your opponent, only to end up defeating your own Magi immediately thereafter, the effects of the Entagle do not disappear -- your opponent will still not be able to play spells on his next turn. [SM 06/23/01] <br>
<br>
ANARCHY <br>
    • The Creatures with Resistance are not affected by either Gloom or Doom. And cannot be chosen for Anarchy, among other things. [TM 06/20/01] <br>
<br>
    • Anarchy is worded so that it cannot be played if any player cannot chose a Creature. [DT 06/21/01] <br>
<br>
BOIL <br>
    • Cald Magi may play Boil when it has been Entombed. [RT 07/13/01] <br>
<br>
BURROW <br>
    • "Burrow" is a specific game mechanic which transcends just the existence of the Burrow Spell. That card text (and others that refer to Burrowing) are simply redundant descriptions of the game mechanic. As such, specific card text may override the Burrow game mechanic, even if they are enacted after the Burrow Spell is already in effect. [SM 02/12/01] <br>
<br>
    • If a Creature is Burrowed, that does not affect how much energy is removed in return when it is the subject of an attack by something else. A Burrowed Creature with 7 energy will still remove 7 in return if something attacks it. [SM 12/10/00] <br>
<br>
    • For multiplayer, don't forget: "X" turns means it's however many turns TOTAL, not just 'your turn' or ' your opponent's turn' unless specified otherwise (i.e., Fogbank). So a Burrow for three turns in a four-player game would burrow for the remainder of Player A's turn, all of Player B's turn, and all of Player C's turn. Player D and beyond are free and clear to attack and damage as they see fit. [SM 12/10/00] <br>
<br>
    • If you burrow using the spell for five turns and for ten on the same turn the two spells start counting down at the same time and you are double burrowed for 5 turns and then single burrowed for the 5 turns after that. [DT 07/27/01] <br>
<br>
CATACLYSM <br>
    • A Cataclysm will not discard Nara's Ergars, Barqua's Bubbled Creature, and a Fird Stone can be used to save a Furok. All of these do not affect Cataclysm itself, but rather prevents or mitigates the effects of the Spell. [RT 11/08/01] <br>
<br>
    • Cataclysm does not "specifically discard creatures." As such, both Collosus and Crystal Parmalag, who are only protected against specific creature discards, are discarded by Cataclysm. Orlon's Anti-Magic'd Barls and Wellisks, however, are protected, since they are unaffected by any opposing spells. [SM 11/12/01] <br>
<br>
CRY OF THUNDER <br>
    • Was it the intent of this card to discard the creatures you summoned after the Attack step, that weren't in play when the spell was played? Yes [DT 05/29/01] <br>
<br>
DEADFALL <br>
    • Without the card texts right in front of me, I'd say yes. It's a Spell, it's discarding energy, Valkan triggers. Pretty good combo. [TM 07/27/01] <br>
<br>
    • Deadfall discards the energy once the Creatures are already in play, so, yes, Wings would prevent two energy loss from each Creature affected. [TM 06/28/01] <br>
<br>
INTENSIFY <br>
    • Using Hubdra's Spear in conjunction with Intensify removes all energy from a Magi, as long as that Magi has at least 2 energy to start with. The Spear is removing energy from the Magi, so that energy loss is doubled with Intensify, even though that energy loss is variable. [DT 05/16/01] <br>
<br>
    • Card intent was cumulative. Activates on announcement of the spell. [DT 05/30/01] <br>
<br>
NIGHTMARE CHANNEL <br>
    • But a NM channel would be different, right? If they interchange after you target them w/ NM channel, their next magi is unaffected, right? Correct. [TM 06/26/01] <br>
<br>
RESONATE <br>
    • Player A has guard wings in play and a 1e creature. Player B wishes to use Resonate to destroy the Wings and kill the 1e creatures. Can he do so? No. Everything Resonate does happens simultaneously, and since the Wings doesn't leave play (and thus lose its Effect) until the Resonate has tried to discard energy from the Creature, the logistics don't pan out. [TM 06/30/01] <br>
<br>
SHOCKWAVE <br>
    • A Shockwave does not cause the creature to lose energy to the point at which it reaches zero. What it does is bodily remove the card from play and move it to the discard pile, without affecting the energy on it at all. <br>
You only then get rid of the energy on the creature because it's already been discarded from play, and you don't keep counters, energy, tokens, etc., on any cards that have left play. [SM 04/30/01] <br>
<br>
SHADOW RAIN <br>
    • If the Creature you used Shadow Rain upon is removed from play before the end of the turn, you still get to draw a card. It is not dependant on the Creature's continued existance for that to occur. [DC 03/06/01] <br>
<br>
    • If Shadow Rain is used during the second P/R/S step, all of the energy from the chosen Creature is returned to your Magi at the end of your Attack step on your next turn. [DT 05/25/01] <br>
<br>
TAP ROOTS <br>
    • You may choose to discard or add 0, 1 or 2 energy idependantly from each other. For example, you may choose to discard 0 from one Creature and add 2 to another. [TM 11/09/00] <br>
<br>
TIDAL WAVE <br>
    • If you are casting this as an out-of-region Spell, you don't need to pay another regional penalty for the bonus removal cost. Optional costs don't incurr the penalty. [TM 11/10/00] <br>
<br>
    • OK - that leads to an interesting question. Can you, with a 10E tidal wave, actually target the SAME creature twice? Thus eliminating the possibility of a single Ummm... No! from cancelling it? Nope. Tidal wave specifically mentions that the second target is a different one: "For an additional four energy you may choose and discard a second Creature from play." [SM 06/12/01] <br>
<br>
TRANQUILITY <br>
    • Treat as if: "Until the beginning of your next turn, if a Spell, Power or Effect would discard energy, that portion of the Spell, Power or Effect has no effect. Draw one additional card during your Draw Step this turn." ADD TO MRP LIST <br>
<br>
    • (with regards to Raxis) Very, very different. Gilded Cage and Underlords Shield look at the outcome. Tranquility looks at the potential. Raxis is not in the category of a Power that ". . . would discard energy . . ." It is in the category of a Power that ". . . may discard energy . . ." It is not a sure thing and so is not prevented by Tranquility. Tranquility prevents Powers/Spells/Effects that are going to remove energy. Raxis may or may not discard energy. Underlords Shield checks to see if the discarded cards were cause by a card of the opponent's, which they were in the case of Giant Vulbor, not if a Power defiantly did or did not discard cards. [DT 06/01/01] <br>
<br>
    • Raxis works under tranquility. Raxis does not fall under the category of "would discard energy." [DT 06/01/01] <br>
<br>
    • You would have to choose to add energy and not discard any energy for both Lightning and Tap Roots. [TM 06/11/01] <br>
<br>
    • For Ogar, if the die roll would discard energy, it instead does nothing (Tranquility prevents you from discarding the energy from your Creatures as well.) [TM 06/11/01] <br>
<br>
UMM...NO! <br>
    • Treat as if: "Play Umm... NO!! when an opponent plays a Spell that would discard one or more of your Creatures from play. Choose one of your Creatures that would be discarded. The chosen Creature is not discarded by the opposing Spell. You may play Umm... NO!! on your opponent's turn." ADD TO MRP LIST <br>
Bottom line: if choices are made, you get to cancel one choice. If no choices are made, then you get to just protect one of your Creatures which otherwise would kick the bucket. <br>
So even if a Spell does more than discard just one of your Creatures, Umm...NO!! can protect a Creature of your choice. Note that this means a full 10e Tidal Wave will still discard one Creature if you play Umm...NO!! You do, however, get to pick which Creature to save. [TM 06/11/01] <br>
<br>
WILL OF OROTHE <br>
    • Will of Orothe grants control of attacks during the attack step and doesn't lock in the current in-play Creatures when it is cast. When the chosen opponent's Attack Step comes around, the player of Will of Orothe decides what attacks will be done with the Creatures that opponent currently controls, whether it be fewer or more than when the Spell was initially cast. [TM 01/11/01] <br>
<br>
    • (with regards to energy band and WoO): Energy Band would force you to choose that Creature to attack one of your Creatures (or your Magi if you didn't have any Creatures). <br>
Will of Orothe lets you act as "Executor of the Attack" but doesn't let you override text in action. For example, you can't use Will of Orothe to make an opponent's Orothan Flyer attack, since normally it can't. And if for some reason it would benefit you, you could choose for an opponent's Creature controlled by Yaki to attack twice. [TM 05/29/01] <br>
<br>
    • A Lovian (due to Resistance) or a Barl or Wellisk controlled by Orlon are not subject to having their attacks determined by a Will of Orothe, as they cannot be affected by the Spell. Similarly, a Shadow Cloaked Core Creature would also be unaffected by the Spell. [RT 08/01/01] <br>
Relic Rulings<br>
Last Updated: 11/15/01 <br>
GENERAL RELIC RULINGS <br>
    • The ruling on Relics specifies that Magi cannot _play_ Relics from other regions. There isn't anything inhibiting them from _using_ the Relics as long as they can get them into play somehow. [TM 12/20/00] <br>
<br>
    • Players do not pay a regional penalty when playing relics that are not of their region. For instance, Warrada may play Essence of Naroom without paying any energy. [DT 05/25/01] <br>
<br>
ABWYN'S QUILL <br>
    • The use of an Abwyn's Quill is triggered when a player announces that they are playing a Spell or using a Power. For example, when your opponent announces that they are playing Submerge, you then may use the Quill to change "Orothe" to "Arderial." In such a case, they would now have to choose an Arderial Creature in play, if there is one. They cannot choose another Creature and have the Submerge voluntarily fail. The whole Spell will only fail if there are no legal choices to make when a choice needs to be made. [TM 05/26/01] <br>
<br>
    • If your Magi is Shadow O'Qua (created by Nagsis), it would be possible for a player to use an Abwyn's Quill to allow her Conjure to bring in Core Creatures. [SM 05/08/01] <br>
<br>
    • No, it just changes _one_ instance of a region name per Spell or Power. If you changed the first "Core" to "Cald," Blight would read: "Discard two energy from each non-Cald, non-Bograth Creature and Magi in play. Add one energy to each Core and Bograth Creature and Magi in play." [SM 07/05/01] <br>
<br>
    • That last part (lasting all turn) is really only referring to stuff that stays in play (Powers and a very few Spells), since once stuff leaves play it loses card memory. And Quill is only referring to the one instance of Spell or Power that you Quilled - if that Spell is retrieved from the discard pile and then played again that same turn you could Quill it again because in essence it's a new Spell, and would not have retained the region change. However, if a Power somehow could be played twice in one turn, the second time it would retain the region change, since it remained in play. <br>
Once per Spell or Power only restricts you from changing more than one region in a Spell or Power. The intention is not to restrict you from Quilling a second instance of the same Spell or Power; rather, Quill can't be used twice on, say, Boil, to change two regional references. [TM 06/28/01] <br>
<br>
    • Only regions from which there are cards released (or in the case of tournaments, legal for play) would be allowed by Abwyn's Quill; it'd otherwise be too ripe for abuse by scurilous players by declaring the "Pickle Region" or some such made-up name ("Honestly, I got an email from Dan, really! He says it's slated for late 2003. I swear, really.") Note that since Awakening was released with both a Kybar's Teeth and a Weave creature each, you can use either of those as legal regions for the Quill. [SM 07/04/01] <br>
<br>
BLAST GLOVES <br>
    • Not unless the Thunderquake or Flame Geyser only discarded energy from a single Creature. As Blast Gloves specifies, it only can be used in those situations. [TM 06/26/01] <br>
<br>
CLIMBING STAFF <br>
    • Climbing Staff can be used whenever a Power, Spell or Effect has an influence on your Magi or hand, whether that be when you first get hit by the PSE or later on, when some ongoing effect is still affecting your hand/Magi. [TM 10/29/01] <br>
<br>
    • Climbing Staff cannot be used to counter Korremar's Mind Shock, as that Power affects a player, and not a Magi or hand. [DT 10/29/01] <br>
<br>
ENERGY BAND <br>
    • Attacking "if able" is only a restriction applied in the Attack Step by the Energy Band. That means that you can use it in the first Powers/Relics/Spells Step regardless of whether the Creature _will_ be able to attack, and then deal with that later, in the Attack Step. At which time the Creature attacks if it can, and doesn't if it can't. [TM 04/22/01] <br>
<br>
FIRD STONE <br>
    • Last week or so, the issue of timing with stuff such as Fird Stone came up. The issue was in timing interpretation; on one count, you had the Fird Stone somehow 'predicting' the future to prevent something from affecting your Furoks, while on the other count you had it reversing an effect that already occurred. Neither was really appropriate as to how it (and similar situations) operates. <br>
So to correct that so that the timing sequence is accurate, we are introducing a new mechanic (or rather, bringing an old term back from the grave in a new form): "As". This isn't actually something new created for this instance, because this timing element will see heavy use in several future cards. In fact, we're jumping the gun a bit with this, as we know this question will arise once Dream's End is out. :-) <br>
Basically, "As" is a situational term that will depend on the context, and describes a procedure whereby you can interrupt an event at a specific point. <br>
In the case of Fird Stone, the rewritten Fird Stone would be worded something like this (this is approximate; I don't know how the exact wording would be): <br>
"Effect - Fird Favor: As a Spell or Power is affecting one or more of your Furoks in play, you may discard two energy from your Magi. If you do, the Spell or Power does not affect any of your Furoks in play." <br>
This essentially allows you to 'short-circuit' the affecting circumstance as it occurs. Like I said, you get the general idea of how it's supposed to work (and we'll integrate it a little better and more formally soon). [RT 09/10/01] <br>
<br>
    • Fird Stone will not be able to rescue anything should Trug's Cataclysm Power be used; when the Magi id discarded from play, all cards controlled by him is discarded as well. [RT 05/01/01] <br>
<br>
GILDED CAGE <br>
    • Gilded Cage and Underlord's Shield look at the outcome of an opposing action to determine whether or not they activate. Since the Giant Vulbor, through energy manipulation, caused you to discard card(s), GC/US would activate. While you are making a choice, your choice is prompted by the Giant Vulbor. [DT 05/03/01] <br>
<br>
    • Most certainly. Discarding Guilded Cage to a Vulbor when you have a choice not to will still draw you their hand's worth of cards. [TM 06/28/01] <br>
<br>
    • If I have a Gilded Cage in my hand and an opponent use a Storm of fishes to discard spells. How many cards do I have to draw? When Gilded Cage activates, everyone has already discarded their cards, so you'd only get six cards, not eight. [TM 07/27/01] <br>
<br>
GORGLE'S GLASSES <br>
    • 1)Can you draw multiple cards with Gorgle's Glasses if a single Spell/Power removes all the energy from several creatures at once? Yes. If you use Thunderquake to discard three opposing creatures, you draw 3 cards. [SM 07/04/01] <br>
<br>
GRIM GOBLET <br>
    • If Grim Goblet is removed from play as a result of your Magi being defeated, it's Effects does not cause you to discard your hand, as it is not your opponent who is discarding the Relic, but rather the game mechanics themselves. [SM 03/03/01] <br>
<br>
    • 2) Stealing a Grim Goblet: This is of course usable immediately by the new controller, correct? Yes. In most cases, the goblet would not likely have been put in play by your opponent that same turn you gain control of it anyway. [SM 06/18/01] <br>
<br>
HOOD OF HIDING <br>
    • If a Hood of Hiding is removed from play after it has been activated, it's Power will continue to operate, since it's not the simple existance of the card or a continuous Effect that is preventing the attack, but rather it is the consequence of an already-activated Power that is providing the protection. As such, the Power will continue along merrily even if the originating object is gone. [SM 12/07/00] <br>
<br>
HUBDRA'S CUBE <br>
    • 1) I use Relic Subversion (Hubdra's Cube) to take control of my opponent's Energy Band. 2) I use Lockdown (Rayje's Belt) on Relic Subversion (Hubdra's Cube). 3) I use Pound Pound Pound (Relic Stalker) to discard my Hubdra's Cube. 4) My opponents Energy Band stays in play under my control even though Hubdra's Cube is discarded. Except that the Cube's Power sets the condition when you use it; Belting that Power does not remove this condition. <br>
It's as if the Cube's Power added the non-Power/non-Effect line to Cube when you use the Power. Because technically, if you had a Relic that could somehow "jump on" other Relics, and it jumped on Hubdra's Cube, and you hadn't used the Cube at all, the "Jumped On" Relic would remain in play if the Cube left play. This is because the Power sets up the discard catch as a one-time condition that applies after you use the Power, but is not part of the Power persay and cannot be "turned off" by turning off the Power. [TM 07/24/01] <br>
<br>
    • Belting Cube's Power would not get you your relic back, since the relic is under your opponent's control (e.g., the cube's Power isn't 'holding' it there) The only way to get your relic back is to steal it back. [SMc 10/31/01] <br>
<br>
MAELSTROM FLASK <br>
    • Read as: "Uncork: Discard Maelstrom Flask from play. Reveal the top four cards of your deck. You may choose any one revealed Spell. If you do, discard all other revealed cards and play the chosen Spell for half of its energy cost, rounded up. If the chosen Spell has an X in its cost, X must equal zero. If you do not choose a Spell, discard all revealed cards." [RT 10/07/01] ADD TO MRP LIST <br>
<br>
MIRROR PENDANT <br>
    • If a Magi's Power has a base cost of 0, a Mirror Pendant may still copy it. It will cost 2 energy (0+2=2) to activate in that situation. [TM 11/10/00] <br>
<br>
    • We need to keep in mind that Mirror Pendant is misworded in UL: as is it lets you play the Power from your Magi even if you don't have any energy to pay for the Power. Basically, it should read: "Power - Auraflection: Choose any one Power on your Magi. You may discard energy from your Magi equal to the chosen Power's cost, and discard an additional two energy. If you do, play all actions of the chosen Power." ADD TO MRP LIST <br>
<br>
RAYJE'S BELT <br>
    • When a Power or Effect is named, it affects all Powers and Effects by that name, even if they are unrelated -- the name is what the Belt reacts off of. For example, if you name "Crushing Sweep" as what will be supressed by the Belt, it will supress both any Powers that are named that as well as any Effects that are named that. [TM 05/02/01] <br>
<br>
SCROLL OF FIRE <br>
    • Although it has the same name as a Spell, Grega's Thermal Blast is a Magi's Power, and not a Spell nor a Creature's Power, and so is thus not affected by a Scroll of Fire. [TM 11/12/00] <br>
<br>
    • Scroll of Fire should read "Whenever a Spell you play or a Power of one of your Creatures removes energy from one or more Creatures, remove one additional energy from each of those Creatures." ADD TO MRP LIST [TM 12/02/00] <br>
